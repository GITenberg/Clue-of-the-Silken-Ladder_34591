<br /><i>DOUBLE TROUBLE</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now I ask you, Lou, what have I done to deserve
such a fate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerking a yellow card from beneath the windshield
of the shiny new maroon-colored sedan, Penny Parker
turned flashing blue eyes upon her companion, Louise
Sidell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Penny,&rdquo; responded her chum dryly, &ldquo;in
Riverview persons who park their cars beside fire
hydrants usually expect to get parking tickets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we were only inside the drugstore five minutes.
Wouldn&rsquo;t you think a policeman could find something
else to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the ticket won&rsquo;t cost you more than five or
ten dollars,&rdquo; teased Louise wickedly. &ldquo;Your father
should pay it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He should but he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny answered gloomily.
&ldquo;Dad expects his one and only daughter to assume
her own car expense. I ask you, what&rsquo;s the good of
having a weekly allowance when you never get to use
it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> in a mood today. Why, I think you&rsquo;re
lucky to have a grand new car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s glance caressed the highly polished chrome
plate, the sleek, streamlined body which shone in the
sunlight. The automobile had been presented to Penny
by her father, Anthony Parker, largely in gratitude
because she had saved his newspaper, <i>The Riverview
Star</i>, from a disastrous law suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am lucky,&rdquo; Penny agreed without enthusiasm.
&ldquo;All the same, I&rsquo;m lonesome for my old coupe,
Leaping Lena. I wish I could have kept her. She was
traded in on this model.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do with that old wreck now,
Penny? Nearly every time we went around a corner
it broke down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, we had marvelous times with her.
This car takes twice as much gasoline. Another thing,
all the policemen knew Lena. They never gave her a
ticket for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sighed deeply. Pocketing the yellow card,
she squeezed behind the steering wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, whatever became of Lena?&rdquo; Louise
asked curiously, slamming the car door. She glanced
sharply at Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s changed hands twice. Now she&rsquo;s at Jake
Harriman&rsquo;s lot, advertised for fifty dollars. Want to
drive past there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly. But I&rsquo;ll do it for your sake, pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the car started toward the Harriman Car Lot,
Louise stole an amused glance at her chum. Penny was
not unattractive, even when submerged in gloom.
Upon the slightest provocation, her blue eyes sparkled;
her smile when she chose to turn it on, would melt a
man of stone. She dressed carelessly, brushed a mop of
curly, golden hair only if it suited her fancy, yet somehow
achieved an appearance envied by her friends.</p>
<p>The automobile drew up at the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Lena.&rdquo; Penny pointed to an ancient blue
coupe with battered fenders which stood on the
crowded second-hand lot. A <i>For Sale</i> sign on the
windshield informed the public that the auto might be
bought for forty dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lena&rsquo;s value seems to have dropped ten dollars,&rdquo;
commented Louise. &ldquo;My, I had forgotten how wrecky
the old thing looks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of her so disrespectfully, Lou. All she
needs is a good waxing and a little paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls crossed the lot to inspect the coupe. As
they were gazing at it, Jake, the lot owner, sidled
toward them, beaming ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, young ladies. May I interest you
in a car?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here is a fine car,&rdquo; went on the dealer, indicating
the coupe. &ldquo;A 1934 model&mdash;good mechanical
condition; nice rubber; a lively battery and fair paint.
You can&rsquo;t go wrong, ladies, not at a price of forty
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will it run?&rdquo; asked Louise, smothering a giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s thousands of miles of good service left in
this little car, ladies. And the price is only fifteen dollars
above the junk value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of Leaping Lena coming to an inglorious
end in a junk yard was disconcerting to
Penny. She walked slowly about the car, inspecting it
from every angle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty dollars is too much for this old wreck,&rdquo; she
said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Penny, such disrespect!&rdquo; mocked Louise.</p>
<p>Penny frowned down her chum. Sentiment and
business were two different matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>will</i> you give?&rdquo; inquired the car owner
alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cent over twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise clutched Penny&rsquo;s arm, trying to pull her
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost your mind?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;What
could you do with this old car when you already have
a new one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not listen. She kept gazing at the coupe
as one who had been hypnotized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take it in a minute, only I don&rsquo;t have twenty-five
dollars in cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much can you raise?&rdquo; asked the dealer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than five dollars, I&rsquo;m afraid. But my
father is publisher of the <i>Riverview Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake Harriman&rsquo;s brows unknitted as if by magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony Parker&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s plenty good enough for me. I&rsquo;ll sell you the
best car on the lot for nothing down. Just come inside
the office and sign a note for the amount. Will
that be okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disregarding Louise&rsquo;s whispered protests, Penny
assured the dealer that the arrangement would be perfectly
satisfactory. The note was signed, and five dollars
in cash given to bind the bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw in a few gallons of gas,&rdquo; the man offered.</p>
<p>However, Jake Harriman&rsquo;s gasoline did not seem
suited to Leaping Lena&rsquo;s dyspeptic ignition. She
coughed feebly once or twice and then died for the
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have acquired a bargain, I must say!&rdquo; exclaimed
Louise. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even get the car home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can,&rdquo; Penny insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tow her. A little
tinkering and she&rsquo;ll be as good as new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re optimistic, to say the least,&rdquo; laughed Louise.</p>
<p>Penny produced a steel cable from the tool kit of
the maroon sedan, and Jake Harriman coupled the
two cars together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, what will your father say when he learns
of this?&rdquo; Louise inquired dubiously. &ldquo;On top of a
parking ticket, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll meet that problem when I come to it,&rdquo;
Penny answered carelessly. &ldquo;Louise, you steer Lena.
I&rsquo;ll drive the sedan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shaking her head sadly, Louise climbed into the
old car. Although Penny was her dearest friend she
was forced to admit that the girl often did bewildering
things. Penny&rsquo;s mother was dead and for many years
she had been raised by a housekeeper, Mrs. Maud
Weems. Secretly Louise wondered if it were not the
housekeeper who had been trained. At any rate, Penny
enjoyed unusual freedom for a high school girl, and
her philosophy of life was summed up in one headline:
ACTION.</p>
<p>Penny put the sedan in gear, towing the coupe
slowly down the street. The two vehicles traveled
several blocks before a hill loomed ahead. Penny considered
turning back, and then decided that the cars
could make the steep climb easily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>However, midway up the hill the sedan suddenly
leaped forward as if released from a heavy burden.
At the same instant Lena&rsquo;s horn gave a sharp warning
blast.</p>
<p>Glancing into the mirror, Penny was horrified to see
Leaping Lena careening backwards down the steep
slope. The tow rope had unfastened.</p>
<p>Bringing the sedan to the curb, she jerked on the
hand brake, and sprang to the pavement. Louise, bewildered
and frightened, was trying desperately to
control the coupe. The car gathered speed, wobbling
crazily toward the line of traffic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guide it! Guide it!&rdquo; shouted Penny. &ldquo;Put on the
brakes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So confused was Louise that she lost her head completely.
Straight toward a long black limousine rolled
the coupe. The chauffeur spun his wheel, but too late.
There was a loud crash as the two cars came together.</p>
<p>Penny raced down the hill to help her chum from
the coupe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Louise shook her head, wailing: &ldquo;Penny Parker,
just see what has happened now! You never should
have bought this stupid old wreck!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Both the chauffeur and an elderly gentleman who
carried a cane, alighted from the limousine. With
grim faces they surveyed the fender which had been
crushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner is Mr. Kohl,&rdquo; Louise whispered nervously.
&ldquo;You know, president of the First National
Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker did not recognize either of the girls.
Addressing them both, he made several pointed remarks
to the effect that irresponsible young people
were very thoughtless to endanger the property of
others with their ancient &ldquo;jalopies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was entirely my fault, Mr. Kohl,&rdquo; acknowledged
Penny meekly. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll pay for the
fender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker softened somewhat, gazing at the girls
in a thoughtful, more friendly way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I seen you somewhere before?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Kohl.&rdquo; Penny was quick to press for
an advantage. &ldquo;Why, I am one of your best customers.
Ever since I was six years old I&rsquo;ve trusted your bank
with my savings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you now,&rdquo; said Mr. Kohl, smiling.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Parker girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adding a mental note that Anthony Parker actually
was one of the bank&rsquo;s largest depositors, he decided
it would be excellent policy to make light of the accident.
A moment later as a policeman came to investigate,
he insisted that the incident had been unavoidable
and that it would be a mistake to arrest the
girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kohl, you were noble, absolutely noble,&rdquo; declared
Penny gratefully after the policeman had gone.
&ldquo;The least I can do is to pay for the damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop at Sherman&rsquo;s Garage and have a new
fender put on,&rdquo; the banker responded. &ldquo;The bill can
be sent to your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Mr. Kohl had driven away, Louise helped
Penny hook the coupe to the sedan once more. She
remarked cuttingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done right well today. One parking ticket,
a bill for twenty-five dollars, and another one coming
up. Just what <i>will</i> your father say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; sighed Penny. &ldquo;I wonder if it might not
be a good idea to break the news by easy stages? Perhaps
he&rsquo;ll take it more calmly if I telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The street was a narrow, dingy one with few business
houses. Noticing a Japanese store which bore a
sign, &ldquo;Kano&rsquo;s Curio Shop,&rdquo; she started toward it, intending
to seek a public telephone.</p>
<p>Louise seized her arm. &ldquo;Penny, you&rsquo;re not going in
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Dorr Street&mdash;one of the worst places in
Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly
safe by daylight. I&rsquo;ll go alone if you&rsquo;re afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus challenged, Louise indignantly denied that
she was afraid, and accompanied her chum.</p>
<p>The door of Mr. Kano&rsquo;s shop stood invitingly open.
Pausing on the threshold, the girls caught a pleasant
aroma of sandalwood.</p>
<p>So quietly did Louise and Penny enter that the
elderly, white-haired shop owner did not immediately
see them. He sat behind a high counter, engrossed in
something he was sewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said Penny pleasantly.</p>
<p>The Japanese glanced up quickly and as quickly
thrust his work beneath the counter. Recovering
poise, he bowed to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we use your telephone if you have one?&rdquo;
Penny requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So very sorry, Miss,&rdquo; the Japanese responded,
bowing again. &ldquo;Have no telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded, absently fingering a tray of tiny
ivory figures. The Japanese watched her, and mistaking
curiosity for buying interest, brought additional
pieces for her to inspect. The curios were all
too expensive for Penny&rsquo;s purse, but after endless debate
she bought a pair of wooden clogs. The shop
owner padded away into a back room, intending to
wrap the package for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Scarcely had he vanished when Penny turned excitedly
to her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, did you notice how funny he acted when we
came in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he didn&rsquo;t want us to see what he was making
evidently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I thought! But we&rsquo;ll fool Mr. Kano!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giving Louise no opportunity to protest, Penny
boldly peered behind the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;But <i>what</i> is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hidden in a pasteboard box lay coil upon coil of
what appeared to be fine, black silk rope. Curiously,
she lifted it up, exposing a network of crossbars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; she exclaimed. <a href="#front">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ladder,
Lou! A ladder made of silk!&rdquo;</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">2</span>
<br /><i>A ROPE OF SILK</i></h2>
<p>Even as Penny spoke, she felt a hard, warning tug
on her skirt. Quickly she turned around.</p>
<p>In the doorway stood the old Japanese. His smile
was not pleasant to behold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-we were just looking at this rope,&rdquo; Penny
stammered, trying to carry off the situation with
dignity. &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Japanese shopkeeper gazed steadily at the girl,
his face an emotionless mask. Since he spoke no word,
it became increasingly evident that he regarded her
with anger and suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask what use is made of this silk rope?&rdquo;
Penny inquired. &ldquo;Do you sell it for a special purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Japanese coldly ignored the direct questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So very sorry to have kept you waiting,&rdquo; he said
softly. &ldquo;Your change please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Penny knew that she deserved the rebuke. Accepting
the package and coins, she and Louise hastily left
the shop. Not until they were some distance away did
the latter speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you would do a trick like that! One of
these days your curiosity will get us into serious
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I learned what was hidden behind the
counter,&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;But that Jap didn&rsquo;t seem
very eager to answer my questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you blame him? It certainly was none of our
affair what he kept inside the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, Lou, but you must admit he acted
strangely when we first entered the shop. You know&mdash;as
if we had surprised him in a questionable act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He naturally was startled. We came in so quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I&rsquo;m not one bit sorry I looked behind
the counter,&rdquo; Penny maintained. &ldquo;I like to learn
about things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, what purpose do you suppose silk ladders
serve? Who uses them and why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how should I know? Penny, you ask enough
questions to be master of ceremonies on a radio quiz
program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t recall ever having seen a silk ladder before,&rdquo;
Penny resumed, undisturbed by her chum&rsquo;s quip.
&ldquo;Would acrobats use them, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge,&rdquo; Louise answered. &ldquo;If I
were in your shoes I should worry about more serious
matters than those connected with a mere silk ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is filled with serious things,&rdquo; sighed
Penny. &ldquo;But mystery! One doesn&rsquo;t run into it every
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do,&rdquo; said Louise brutally. &ldquo;If a stranger
twitches his ears twice you immediately suspect him
of villainy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, being of a suspicious nature won me
a new car,&rdquo; Penny defended herself. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget
Dad gave it to me for solving a mystery, for telling his
newspaper readers what was going on <i>Behind the
Green Door</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your curiosity has paid dividends,&rdquo; Louise admitted
with a laugh. &ldquo;Take for instance the time you
trailed the <i>Vanishing Houseboat</i>, and again when you
lowered the Kippenberg drawbridge to capture a
boatload of crooks! Those were the days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why dwell in the past, Lou? Now take this affair
of the silk ladder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> have to take it,&rdquo; Louise interrupted.
&ldquo;Do you realize it&rsquo;s nearly four o&rsquo;clock? In
exactly ten minutes I am supposed to be at the auditorium
for orchestra practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, you can&rsquo;t desert me now,&rdquo; Penny protested
quickly. &ldquo;How will I get Lena home? I need you to
steer her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I don&rsquo;t trust your tow rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least go as far as the <i>Star</i> office with me. Once
there, maybe I can get one of the reporters to help
me the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Louise consented. &ldquo;But the <i>Star</i>
office is my absolute limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deciding not to take time to telephone her father,
Penny once more climbed into the maroon sedan,
posting Louise behind the wheel of the coupe. At a
cautious speed the two cars proceeded along the
street, coming presently to a large corner building
which housed the <i>Riverview Star</i>. No parking space
being available on the street, Penny pulled into the
newspaper plant&rsquo;s loading dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you!&rdquo; shouted a man who was tossing stacks
of freshly inked papers into a truck. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t park
that caravan in here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s eyes danced mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s quite all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I guess you don&rsquo;t
know who I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I do,&rdquo; the trucker grinned. &ldquo;But your dad
gave orders that the next time you tried to pull that
daughter-of-the-publisher stuff we were to bounce
you! This dock is for <i>Star</i> trucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the very idea,&rdquo; said Penny, with pretended
injury. &ldquo;The night edition doesn&rsquo;t roll for an hour
and I&rsquo;ll be away from here before then! Besides, this
is a great emergency! When Dad hears about all the
trouble I&rsquo;m in, a little matter such as this won&rsquo;t even
ruffle him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, chase along,&rdquo; the trucker returned good-naturedly.
&ldquo;But see to it that you&rsquo;re out of here within
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny bade Louise good-bye, and with plaid skirt
swinging jauntily, crossed the cement runway to the
rear elevator entrance. Without waiting for the cage
to descend, she took the steps two at a time, arriving
at the editorial floor gasping for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your rush?&rdquo; inquired an amused voice.
&ldquo;Going to a fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry Livingston, ace reporter for the <i>Star</i>, leaned
indolently against the grillwork of the elevator shaft,
his finger pressed on the signal button. He and Penny
were friends of long standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Jerry!&rdquo; Penny greeted him breathlessly.
&ldquo;Guess what? I&rsquo;ve just come from Dorr Street&mdash;Kano&rsquo;s
Curio Shop&mdash;and I had the most amazing adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine,&rdquo; grinned Jerry. &ldquo;If you breezed
through the place the way you do this building, you
must have left it in ruins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for that, I won&rsquo;t tell you a thing, not a thing,&rdquo;
retorted Penny. &ldquo;What sort of a mood is Dad in today?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I heard him tell DeWitt that unless the news
output improves on this sheet, he aims to fire half
the force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like Dad on one of his bad days,&rdquo; Penny
sighed. &ldquo;Maybe I should skip home without seeing
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble with the old allowance again?&rdquo; Jerry
asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the half of it. I&rsquo;m submerged so
deeply in debt that I&rsquo;ll be an old lady before I get out,
unless Dad comes to my rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good luck,&rdquo; chuckled Jerry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking through the newsroom, between aisles of
desks where busy reporters tapped on their typewriters,
Penny paused before a door marked: <i>Anthony
Parker, Editor</i>.</p>
<p>Listening a moment and hearing no voices within,
she knocked and entered. Her father, a lean, dignified
man with tired lines about his eyes and mouth, sat
working at his desk. He smiled as he saw his daughter,
and waved her toward a chair.</p>
<p>Instead, Penny perched herself on a corner of the
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I have a splendid surprise for you,&rdquo; she began
brightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just accomplished a wonderful
stroke of business!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind beating about the bush,&rdquo; interrupted
Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Shoot me the facts straight. What have
you done this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, your tone! I&rsquo;ve bought back my old car,
Leaping Lena. And it only cost me a trifling sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker&rsquo;s chair squeaked as he whirled around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, Dad. Now don&rsquo;t think that I fail
to appreciate the grand new car you gave me last
winter. I love it. But between Lena and me there exists
a deep bond of affection. Today when I saw her on
Jake Harriman&rsquo;s lot looking so weather-beaten and unhappy&mdash;why,
a little voice inside me whispered:
&lsquo;Penny, why don&rsquo;t you buy her back?&rsquo; So I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the sentimental touches. When I gave
you the new car I thought we were well rid of Lena.
How much did you pay for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lena was a marvelous bargain. Five dollars
cash and a note for twenty more. The man said you
could pay for it at your convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very considerate of him,&rdquo; Mr. Parker remarked
ironically. &ldquo;Now that we have three cars, and a double
garage, where do you propose to keep Lena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, anywhere. In the back yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on the lawn, young lady. And what do you
plan to do with two cars?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The maroon one for style, and Lena when I want
a good time. Why, Dad, she bears the autographs of
nearly all my school friends! I should keep her as a
souvenir, if for no other reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, it&rsquo;s high time you learned a few lessons in
finance.&rdquo; Mr. Parker spoke sternly although his mouth
twitched slightly. &ldquo;I regret that I cannot assume your
debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad! I&rsquo;m a minor&mdash;under legal age. Isn&rsquo;t it a
law that a father has to support his child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child, but not two cars. If you decide to take
the case to court, I think any reasonable judge will
understand my viewpoint. I repeat, the debt is yours,
not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will I pay?&rdquo; asked Penny gloomily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already
borrowed on my allowance for a month ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;However, with your ingenuity
I am sure you can manage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny drew a deep breath. Argument, she realized,
would be utterly useless. While her father might be
mildly amused by her predicament, he never would
change his decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you won&rsquo;t pay for Lena, I suppose it&rsquo;s useless
to mention Mr. Kohl&rsquo;s fender,&rdquo; she said despairingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he have one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t try to be funny, Dad. This is tragic.
While I was towing Lena, the rope broke and smash
went the fender of Mr. Kohl&rsquo;s slinky black limousine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to promise to pay for it to keep from being
arrested. Oh, yes, and before that I acquired this little
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tossed the yellow card across the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A parking ticket! Penny, how many times&mdash;&rdquo; Mr.
Parker checked himself, finishing in a calm voice:
&ldquo;This, too, is your debt. It may cost you five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, you know I can&rsquo;t pay. Think how your reputation
will be tarnished if I am sent to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker smiled and reached as if to take money
from his pocket. Reconsidering, he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the warden well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrange for
you to be assigned to one of the better cells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there nothing which will move you to generosity?&rdquo;
pleaded Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retrieving the parking ticket, Penny jammed it into
her pocket. Before she could leave there came a rap
on the door. In response to Mr. Parker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo;
Mr. DeWitt, the city editor, entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to bother you, Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong now, DeWitt?&rdquo; the publisher inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Hilderman was taken sick a few minutes ago.
We had to send her home in a cab.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing serious I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker with
concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mild heart attack. She&rsquo;ll be out a week, if not
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Be sure to have the treasurer give her full
pay. You have someone to take her place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the problem,&rdquo; moaned DeWitt. &ldquo;Her assistant
is on vacation. I don&rsquo;t know where we can get
a trained society editor on short notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do the best you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt lingered, fingering a paper weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The society page for the Sunday paper is only half
finished,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Deadline&rsquo;s in less than an
hour. Not a chance we can pick up anyone in time to
meet it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny spoke unexpectedly. &ldquo;Mr. DeWitt, perhaps I
can help you. I&rsquo;m a whiz when it comes to writing
society. Remember the Kippenberg wedding I covered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; DeWitt&rsquo;s face relaxed into a broad grin.
&ldquo;That was a real write-up. Say, maybe you could take
over Miss Hilderman&rsquo;s job until we can replace her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Service is my motto.&rdquo; Penny eyed her father questioningly.
&ldquo;It might save the <i>Star</i> from going to press
minus a society page. How about it, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly would solve our problem,&rdquo; contributed
DeWitt. &ldquo;Of course the undertaking might be too great
a one for your daughter.&rdquo; He winked at Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have no difficulty in taking over,&rdquo; said Mr.
Parker stiffly. &ldquo;None whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll start her in at once,&rdquo; DeWitt replied.
&ldquo;Come with me, Miss Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the door Penny paused and discreetly allowed
the city editor to get beyond hearing. Then, turning
to her father she remarked innocently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, we overlooked one trifling detail.
The salary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editor made a grimace. &ldquo;I might have expected
this. Very well, I&rsquo;ll pay you the same as I do Miss
Hilderman. Twenty-five a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that would just take care of my debt to Jake
Harriman,&rdquo; protested Penny. &ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t do high
pressure work without high pay. Shall we make it
fifty a week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re holding me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;Merely using
my ingenuity. Am I hired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you win,&rdquo; answered Mr. Parker grimly. &ldquo;But
see to it that you turn out good work. Otherwise, you
soon may find yourself on the <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> inactive list.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>SOCIETY ROUTINE</i></h2>
<p>Penny followed City Editor DeWitt to a
small, glass-enclosed office along the left hand wall of
the newsroom. Miss Hilderman&rsquo;s desk was cluttered
with sheets of copy paper which bore scribbled notations,
items telephoned to the <i>Star</i> but not yet type-written.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be a date book around here somewhere,&rdquo;
DeWitt remarked.</p>
<p>Finally he found it in one of the desk drawers.
Penny drew a deep breath as she scanned the long list
of social events which must be covered for the Sunday
page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the best you can,&rdquo; DeWitt said encouragingly.
&ldquo;Work fast, but be careful of names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone bell rang. As Penny reached for the
receiver, DeWitt retreated to his own domain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Miss Hilderman?&rdquo; a feminine voice cooed,
&ldquo;I wish to report a meeting, please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Hilderman isn&rsquo;t here this afternoon,&rdquo; replied
Penny politely. &ldquo;I will take the item.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gathering up paper and pencil, she slid into the revolving
chair behind the telephone, poised for action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a lengthy pause, and then the woman at
the other end of the line recited as if she were reading
from a paper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A meeting of the Mystical Society of Celestial
Thought, Order of Amar, 67, will be held Tuesday
night at eight o&rsquo;clock in the Temple, 426 Butternut
Lane. The public is cordially invited.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of society is the Order of Amar?&rdquo;
Penny inquired curiously, taking notes. &ldquo;I never heard
of it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear, the society is very well known,&rdquo;
the woman replied. &ldquo;We hold our meetings regularly,
communing with the spirits. I do hope that the item
appears in print. So often Miss Hilderman has been
careless about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that the item is printed under club notices,&rdquo;
Penny promised. &ldquo;Your name, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman had hung up the receiver, so with a
shrug, Penny typed the item and speared it on a wire
spindle. For the next hour she was kept busy with
other telephone calls and the more important stories
which had to be rushed through. Copy flowed steadily
from her office by way of the pneumatic tube to the
composing room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Shortly after five o&rsquo;clock, DeWitt dropped in for a
moment to praise her for her speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So far I&rsquo;ve only
caught you in one mistake. Mignonette is spelled with
a double t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This job wouldn&rsquo;t be half bad if only brides could
learn to carry flowers with easy names,&rdquo; laughed
Penny. &ldquo;When I get married I&rsquo;ll have violets and
sweet peas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt reached for the copy on the spindle.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;More to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Club notices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editor tore the sheet from the wire, reading it
as he walked toward the door. Abruptly, he paused
and turned toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parker, this can&rsquo;t go through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is wrong?&rdquo; Penny asked in surprise.
&ldquo;Have I made another error in spelling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt tore off the lead item and tossed it on her
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this meeting of the so-called Mystical Society
of Celestial Thought. The <i>Star</i> never runs stuff like
that, not even as a paid advertisement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was a regular lodge meeting, Mr. DeWitt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort. Merely a free advertisement
for a group of mediums and charlatans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; murmured Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These meetings have only one purpose,&rdquo; Mr. DeWitt
resumed. &ldquo;To lure victims who later may be
fleeced of their money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if that is so, why don&rsquo;t police close up the
place?&rdquo; Penny demanded. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t the <i>Star</i> run
an expos&eacute; story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because evidence isn&rsquo;t easy to get. The meetings
usually are well within the law. Whenever a police
detective or a reporter attends, the services are decorous.
But they provide the mediums with a list of
suckers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny would have asked DeWitt for additional information
had not the city editor walked hurriedly
away. Scrambling the item into a ball, she tossed it
into the waste paper basket. Then upon second
thought she retrieved it and carefully smoothed the
paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, I&rsquo;ll drop around at the Temple sometime
just to see what it is like,&rdquo; she decided, placing
the item in her pocket. &ldquo;It would be interesting to
learn what is going on there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>For the next half hour Penny had no time to think
of the Celestial Temple. However, at twenty minutes
before six, when her father came into the office, she
was well ahead of her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Penny,&rdquo; he greeted her. &ldquo;How do you like
your new job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine and dandy. Only routine items rather cramp
one&rsquo;s style. Now if I were a regular reporter instead of
a society editor, I know several stories which would
be my dish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Parker, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, there&rsquo;s an Oriental Shop on Dorr Street that
I should investigate. The Japanese owner acted very
mysteriously today when I went there. Louise and I
saw him making a silk ladder, and he refused to reveal
its purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A silk ladder?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Odd perhaps,
but hardly worthy of a news story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I only wish you had <i>seen</i> that old Japanese&mdash;the
sinister way he looked at me. Oh, he&rsquo;s guilty of
some crime. I feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Star</i> requires facts, not fancy or emotion,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker rejoined. &ldquo;Better devote your talents to
routine society items if you expect to remain on my
payroll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny took the announcement of the Celestial
Thought meeting from her pocket and offered it to
the publisher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one which might be interesting,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;How about assigning me to it after I get this society
job in hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker read the item and his eyes blazed with
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what this means, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. DeWitt told me a little about the Celestial
Temple society. He said the paper never ran such
items.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! Why, I should like nothing better
than to see the entire outfit driven out of town! Riverview
is honeycombed with mediums, fortune tellers
and faith healers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they mean no harm, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grant there may be a small number of persons
who honestly try to communicate with the spirit
world,&rdquo; Mr. Parker replied. &ldquo;My concern is not with
them, but with a group of professional mediums who
lately have invaded the city. Charlatans, crooks&mdash;the
entire lot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write an editorial about it?&rdquo; Penny
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An editorial! I am seriously tempted to start a
vigorous campaign, but the trouble is, the police cannot
be depended upon to cooperate actively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because experience has proven that such campaigns
are not often successful. Evidence is hard to gain. If
one place is closed up, others open in different sections
of the city. The mediums and seers operate from
dozens of private homes. When the police stage raids
they acquire no evidence, and only succeed in making
the department look ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet the mediums continue to fleece the public?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more gullible strata of it. Until recent months
the situation here has been no worse than in other
cities of comparable size. Lately an increasing number
of charlatans has moved in on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you start a campaign, Dad?&rdquo; Penny
urged. &ldquo;You would be doing the public a worthwhile
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hesitate to start something which I may be
unable to finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least the public deserves to be warned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, Penny, many persons would take
the attitude that the <i>Star</i> was persecuting sincere
spiritualists. A campaign must be based on absolute
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it be obtained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without great difficulty. These mediums are
a clever lot, Penny. They prey upon the superstitions
of their intended victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would let me work on the story, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Penny,&rdquo; responded her father. &ldquo;You attend to
your society and allow DeWitt to worry about the
Celestial Temple crowd. Even if I should launch a
campaign, I couldn&rsquo;t allow you to become mixed up in
the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone bell jingled. With a tired sigh, Penny
reached for the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Society desk,&rdquo; she said mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am trying to trace Mr. Parker,&rdquo; informed the
office exchange operator. &ldquo;Is he with you, Miss
Parker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone, Dad,&rdquo; said Penny, offering him the receiver.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker waited a moment for another connection
to be made. Then Penny heard him say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Mrs. Weems? What&rsquo;s that? Repeat
it, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From her father&rsquo;s tone, Penny felt certain that
something had gone wrong at home. She arose, waiting
anxiously.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker clicked the receiver several times. &ldquo;Apparently,
Mrs. Weems hung up,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mr. Parker admitted, his face
troubled. &ldquo;Mrs. Weems seemed very excited. She requested
me to come home as soon as possible. Then
the connection was broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try to reach her again?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker placed an out-going call, but after ten
minutes the operator reported that she was unable to
contact the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems never would have telephoned if
something unusual hadn&rsquo;t happened,&rdquo; Penny declared
uneasily. &ldquo;Perhaps, she&rsquo;s injured herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think of such unpleasant things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something dreadful must have happened,&rdquo; Penny
insisted. &ldquo;Otherwise, why doesn&rsquo;t she answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only wasting time in idle speculation,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker said crisply. &ldquo;Get your things, Penny. We&rsquo;ll
start home at once!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>

<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>A TURN OF FORTUNE</i></h2>
<p>Penny immediately locked her desk and
gathered up hat and gloves. She was hard pressed to
keep pace with her father as they hastened to the
elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, you have your car downstairs?&rdquo; the
publisher inquired absently. He seldom drove his own
automobile to the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a memory you have, Dad!&rdquo; chuckled Penny.
&ldquo;Yes, I have all two of them! Parked in the loading
dock for convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, haven&rsquo;t I told you a dozen times&mdash;&rdquo; Mr.
Parker began, only to check himself. &ldquo;Well, it will
save us time now. However, we may discuss a few
matters when we get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator shot them down to the first floor.
Leaping Lena and the maroon sedan remained in the
loading dock with a string of <i>Star</i> paper trucks blocking
a portion of the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, sister,&rdquo; a trucker called angrily to Penny.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you&rsquo;re getting these cars out of here.&rdquo; He
broke off as he recognized Mr. Parker and faded behind
one of the trucks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, do you mind steering Lena?&rdquo; Penny asked
demurely. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave her here. You can see for
yourself that she seems to be blocking traffic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; Mr. Parker responded grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you would feel more dignified driving
the sedan&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have the keys,&rdquo; the publisher interrupted.
&ldquo;The important thing is to get home without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny became sober, and slid into her place at the
wheel of Leaping Lena. Amid the smiles of the truckers,
Mr. Parker drove the two cars out of the dock.</p>
<p>Once underway, the caravan made reckless progress
through rush-hour traffic. More than once Penny
whispered a prayer as Lena swayed around a corner,
missing other cars by scant inches.</p>
<p>Presently the two automobiles drew up before a
pleasant, tree-shaded home built upon a high terrace
overlooking a winding river. Penny and her father
alighted, walking hurriedly toward the front porch.</p>
<p>The door stood open and from within came the reassuring
howl of a radio turned too high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing so very serious can have happened,&rdquo; remarked
Penny. &ldquo;Otherwise, Mrs. Weems wouldn&rsquo;t
have that thing going full blast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>At the sound of footsteps, the housekeeper herself
came into the living room from the kitchen. Her
plump face was unusually animated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t mind because I telephoned the
office, Mr. Parker,&rdquo; she began apologetically. &ldquo;I was
so excited, I just did it before I stopped to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny and I were nearly ready to start home in
any case, Mrs. Weems. Has anything gone wrong
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mr. Parker. It was the telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telegram? One for me, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my own.&rdquo; The housekeeper drew a yellow
paper from the pocket of her apron, offering it to the
publisher. &ldquo;My Cousin David died out in Montana,&rdquo;
she explained. &ldquo;The funeral was last Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; remarked Penny sympathetically.
And then she added: &ldquo;Only you don&rsquo;t look particularly
sad, Mrs. Weems. How much did he leave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny! You say such shocking things! I never met
Cousin David but once in my life. He was a kind, good
man and I only wish I had written to him more often.
I never dreamed he would remember me in his will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he did leave you money!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny
triumphantly. &ldquo;How much does the telegram say,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well tell her, Mr. Parker,&rdquo; sighed the
housekeeper. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll give me no peace until she learns
every detail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This message which is from a Montana lawyer
mentions six thousand dollars,&rdquo; returned the publisher.
&ldquo;Apparently, the money is to be turned over without
legal delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Weems, you&rsquo;re an heiress!&rdquo; cried
Penny admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Weems.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any mistake, Mr. Parker? It
would be too cruel if someone had sent the message as
a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before returning the telegram to the housekeeper,
Mr. Parker switched off the radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This message appears to be authentic,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;My congratulations upon your good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with all your money?&rdquo; inquired
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The housekeeper sank into a
chair, her eyes fastening dreamily on a far wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her father exchanged a quick, alarmed
glance. Mrs. Weems had been in charge of the household
for so many years that they could not imagine
living without her, should she decide to leave. During
her brief, infrequent vacations, the house always degenerated
into a disgrace of dust and misplaced furniture,
and meals were never served at regular hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The oceans are very unsafe, Mrs. Weems,&rdquo; discouraged
Penny. &ldquo;Wars and submarines and things.
Surely you wouldn&rsquo;t dare travel now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I mean in the United States,&rdquo; replied the
housekeeper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go out West.
They say the Grand Canyon is so pretty it takes your
breath away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, you have worked for us long and
faithfully and deserve a rest,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker, trying
to speak heartily. &ldquo;Now if you would enjoy a trip,
Penny and I will get along somehow for two or three
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I go, I&rsquo;ll stay the entire summer.&rdquo; The
housekeeper hesitated, then added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed
working here, Mr. Parker, but doing the same thing
year after year gets tiresome. Often I&rsquo;ve said to myself
that if I had a little money I would retire and take
life easy for the rest of my days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Weems, you&rsquo;re only forty-eight!&rdquo; protested
Penny. &ldquo;You would be unhappy if you didn&rsquo;t
have any work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind trying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a change as you contemplate should be considered
carefully,&rdquo; contributed Mr. Parker. &ldquo;While
six thousand seems a large sum it would not last long
if one had no other income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Weems could reply, a strong odor of
burning food permeated the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The roast!&rdquo; exclaimed the housekeeper. &ldquo;I forgot
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny rushed ahead of her to the kitchen. As she
jerked open the oven door, out poured a great cloud
of smoke. Seizing a holder, she rescued the meat, and
seeing at a glance that it was burned to a crisp, carried
the pan outdoors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will the neighbors say?&rdquo; Mrs. Weems
moaned. &ldquo;I never did a thing like that before. It&rsquo;s just
that I am so excited I can&rsquo;t think what I am doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get dinner
tonight. You entertain Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With difficulty she persuaded the housekeeper to
abandon the kitchen. Left to herself, she opened a
can of cold meat, a can of corn, a can of peaches, and
with a salad already prepared, speedily announced the
meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker, I truly am ashamed&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Weems
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t apologize for my cooking,&rdquo; broke in
Penny. &ldquo;Quantity before quality is my motto. Anyway,
if you are leaving, Dad will have to accustom
himself to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hide the can opener,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before I go, I&rsquo;ll try to teach Penny a little more
about cooking,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems said uncomfortably.
&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;ll have no difficulty in getting someone
efficient to take my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can take your place,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;If
you leave, Dad and I will go to wrack and ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a pair when you&rsquo;re left to yourselves,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems sighed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one thing which
makes me hesitate. Penny needs someone to keep her
in check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An inexperienced person would be putty in my
hands,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;You may as well decide to
stay, Mrs. Weems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I&rsquo;ve planned on this trip
for years. Now that it is possible, I feel I can&rsquo;t give it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Mr. Parker regarded each other across
the table, and immediately changed the subject. Not
until that moment had they actually believed that the
housekeeper was serious about leaving Riverview.
Somehow they had never contemplated a future without
Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happen to have two complimentary tickets to
a show at the Rialto,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said offhand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be tied up with a meeting tonight, but you folks might
enjoy going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we, Mrs. Weems?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; responded the housekeeper, &ldquo;but I
doubt if I could sit still tonight. I thought I would run
over to see Mrs. Hodges after dinner. She&rsquo;ll be pleased
to learn about my inheritance, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of yours?&rdquo; asked Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Penny and I have been acquainted with her
for years. She lives on Christopher Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps this is none of my affair, Mrs. Weems.
However, my advice to you is not to tell many persons
about your inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Hodges is to be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it, Mrs. Weems. I refer to strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; the housekeeper promised. &ldquo;No
one ever will get that money away from me once I
have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny helped with the dishes, and then as her father
was leaving the house, asked him if she might have the
two theatre tickets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Mrs. Weems doesn&rsquo;t care to go, I&rsquo;ll invite
Louise,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker gave her the tickets. Making certain that
the housekeeper was upstairs, he spoke in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, Mrs. Weems is serious about leaving us.
You must try to dissuade her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you usually have a few ideas in the old filing
cabinet. Can&rsquo;t you think of something?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; Penny said with a twinkle. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t let an inheritance take Mrs. Weems from us,
that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After her father had gone, Penny telephoned
Louise, agreeing to meet her chum at the entrance of
the Rialto. Arriving a few minutes early, she idly
watched various cars unloading their passengers at the
theatre.</p>
<p>Presently a long black limousine which Penny
recognized drew up at the curb. The chauffeur opened
the door. Mr. Kohl and his wife stepped to the pavement.
Observing the girl, they paused to chat with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have the new fender installed on your
car, Mr. Kohl,&rdquo; Penny remarked with a grin. &ldquo;May I
ask how much I owe the garageman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sum was trifling,&rdquo; responded the banker.
&ldquo;Twelve dollars and forty cents to be exact. I may
as well take care of it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I insist,&rdquo; said Penny, wincing inwardly. &ldquo;You
see, I am one of the <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> highly paid executives now.
I write society in Miss Hilderman&rsquo;s absence and Dad
gives me a salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, really,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Kohl with interest.
&ldquo;We are giving a dinner for eight tomorrow night.
You might like to mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes,&rdquo; said Penny eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Obtaining complete details, she jotted notes on the
back of an envelope. Mrs. Kohl, at Penny&rsquo;s request,
was able to recall several important parties which had
been held that week, providing material for nearly
a half-column of society.</p>
<p>After the Kohls had entered the theatre, Penny
turned to glance at the black limousine which was
pulling away from the curb. A short distance away
stood a young man who likewise appeared to be
watching the car. He wore a gray suit and a gray felt
hat pulled unnaturally low over his eyes as if to shield
his face.</p>
<p>As Penny watched, the young man jotted something
down on a piece of paper. His gaze remained fixed
upon the Kohl limousine which was moving slowly
down the street toward a parking lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s odd!&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;I do believe
he noted down the car license number! And perhaps
for no good purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>THE MAN IN GRAY</i></h2>
<p>Deciding that the matter should be brought to
Mr. Kohl&rsquo;s attention, Penny looked quickly into the
crowded theatre lobby. The banker and his wife no
longer were to be seen.</p>
<p>Turning once more, the girl saw that the young
man in gray had also disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where did he go?&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;He must
have slipped into the alley. I wish I knew who he was
and why he wrote down that car license number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curious to learn what had become of the man, she
walked to the entrance of the alley. At its far end she
could barely distinguish a shadowy figure which soon
merged into the black of the starless night.</p>
<p>Penny was lost in thought when someone touched
her arm. Whirling, she found herself facing Louise
Sidell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Lou,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;You startled me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have kept you waiting,&rdquo; apologized
Louise. &ldquo;I missed my bus. May I ask what you find
of such interest in this alley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for a man. He&rsquo;s disappeared now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny told Louise what she had observed, mentioning
that in her opinion the man might be a car
thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that crooks spot cars ahead of time and
then steal them,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I think I should have
Mr. Kohl paged in the theatre, and tell him about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make yourself appear ridiculous if you do,&rdquo;
Louise discouraged her. &ldquo;The man may not have taken
down the license number at all. Even if he did, his
purpose could have been a legitimate one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did he slip down the alley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely a short-cut to another street, isn&rsquo;t it?
Penny, your imagination simply works at high speed
twenty-four hours of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Penny with a shrug. &ldquo;But if
Mr. Kohl&rsquo;s car is stolen, don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; laughed Louise, linking arms with
her chum. &ldquo;Not with a chauffeur at the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the theatre, the girls were escorted to their
seats only a few minutes before the lights were lowered.
Penny glanced over the audience but failed to see
either Mr. Kohl or his wife. The curtain went up, and
as the entertainment began, she dismissed all else from
her mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>The show ended shortly before eleven and the girls
mingled with the crowd which filed from the theatre.
Penny watched for Mr. and Mrs. Kohl but did not see
them. As she walked with Louise toward the bus stop
she spoke of her new duties as society editor of the
<i>Star</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou,&rdquo; she asked abruptly, &ldquo;do you mind going
home alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. Where are you taking yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the <i>Star</i> office, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a few notes I should type. Unfinished work
always makes me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, nervous!&rdquo; Louise scoffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you want
to see Jerry Livingston!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; denied Penny indignantly. &ldquo;Jerry
doesn&rsquo;t work on the night force unless he&rsquo;s assigned to
extra duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have something besides work on your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along with me, Suspicious, and I&rsquo;ll prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; declined Louise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s home and bed
for me. You run along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls separated, Penny walking three blocks to
the <i>Star</i> building. The advertising office was dark,
but blue-white lights glowed weirdly from the composing
room. Only a skeleton night staff occupied the
newsroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Without attracting attention, Penny entered her
own office. For an hour she worked steadily, writing
copy, and experimenting with various types of
make-up to be used on Monday&rsquo;s page.</p>
<p>The door creaked. Glancing up, Penny momentarily
was startled to see a large, grotesque shadow of
a man moving across the glass panel. However, before
she actually could be afraid, Jerry Livingston stepped
into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; she laughed in relief. &ldquo;I thought it
was against your principles to work overtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter slumped into a chair, and picking up
a sheet of copy paper, began to read what Penny had
composed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not working,&rdquo; he replied absently. &ldquo;Just killing
time.&rdquo; With a yawn he tossed the paper on the desk
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my stuff that bad?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad at all. Better than Miss Hilderman writes.
But society always gives me a pain. Not worthy of
your talents, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell Dad that, Jerry. I&rsquo;d love to
work on a big story again&mdash;one that would rock
Riverview on its foundation!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could bear up under a little excitement myself,
Penny. Ever since you broke the Green Door yarn,
this sheet has been as dead as an Egyptian tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things may pick up soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad is thinking rather seriously of launching a
drive against an organized group of mediums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I hear,&rdquo; nodded Jerry. &ldquo;You know, for a long
while I&rsquo;ve thought that a clever reporter might be
able to dig up some evidence at the Celestial Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know about the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there several times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the meetings like, Jerry?&rdquo; Penny asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Similar to a church musical service. At least everything
was dignified when I was there. But I sure had
a feeling that the lid was about to blow off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you were suspected of being a <i>Star</i> reporter,
Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, undoubtedly. I could tell that by the way folks
stared at me. The only person who would have a
chance to get real evidence would be someone unknown
as a reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Dad would let me try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jerry flatly. &ldquo;The Celestial Temple
is no place for a little girl like you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Penny did not reply as she lowered her typewriter
into the cavity of the desk. She was thinking, however,
that if Louise could be persuaded to accompany her,
she would investigate the Celestial Temple at the first
opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you home,&rdquo; Jerry offered as Penny
reached for her hat.</p>
<p>The night was a warm, mellow one in early June,
marred only by dark clouds which scudded overhead,
threatening rain. Deciding to walk, Penny and Jerry
crossed the park to Oakdale Drive where many of
Riverview&rsquo;s most expensive homes had been built.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Kohl live on this street?&rdquo; Penny presently
asked her escort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;in a large stone apartment
building. I&rsquo;ll point it out when we get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked for a time in silence. Then Penny
found herself telling about the afternoon meeting with
Mr. Kohl which had led her to Kano&rsquo;s Curio Shop.
She spoke, too, of the silken ladder which had so
aroused her speculation. Jerry listened with polite interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Louise shouldn&rsquo;t have chased around
Dorr Street alone,&rdquo; he said severely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was safe enough, Jerry. I&rsquo;d like to go back
there. I can&rsquo;t help being curious about that strange
ladder which the old Japanese man was sewing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if there&rsquo;s a story connected with it. The
Japanese make any number of curious articles of silk,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a ladder, Jerry! What purpose could it serve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing it would be more convenient to
carry than the ordinary type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One couldn&rsquo;t stand it against a wall or use it in the
ordinary way, Jerry. I asked the Japanese about it
but he refused to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may not have understood you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he understood, all right. Do you know what I
think? He was afraid I might discover something
which would involve him with the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better forget the Kano Curio Shop,&rdquo; Jerry said
tolerantly. &ldquo;I repeat, Dorr Street is no place for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m supposed to forget the Celestial Temple,
too,&rdquo; grumbled Penny. &ldquo;Oh, I see you grinned behind
your hand! Well, Mr. Livingston, let me tell you&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and Jerry&rsquo;s hand tightened on her own.
Unmistakably, both had heard a muffled scream. The
cry seemed to have come from one of several large
brick and stone buildings only a short distance ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Penny asked in a low tone.
&ldquo;Someone calling for help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure sounded like it!&rdquo; exclaimed Jerry. &ldquo;Come
on, Penny! Let&rsquo;s find out what&rsquo;s going on here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>AN APARTMENT BURGLARY</i></h2>
<p>Together Penny and Jerry ran down the
street, their eyes raised to the unevenly lighted windows
of the separate apartment houses. They were
uncertain as to the building from which the cry had
come.</p>
<p>Suddenly the front door of the corner dwelling
swung open, and a young woman in a maid&rsquo;s uniform
ran toward them.</p>
<p>Jerry, ever alert for a story of interest to the <i>Star</i>,
neatly blocked the sidewalk. Of necessity the girl
halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a policeman, quick!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Mr. Kohl&rsquo;s
apartment has been robbed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kohl&mdash;the banker?&rdquo; demanded Penny,
scarcely believing her ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; the maid said in agitation. &ldquo;Jewels, silverware,
everything has been taken! The telephone
wire was cut, too! Oh, tell me where I&rsquo;ll find a policeman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get one for you,&rdquo; offered Jerry.</p>
<p>The information that it was Mr. Kohl&rsquo;s house which
had been burglarized dumbfounded Penny. As the reporter
darted away to summon help, she showered
questions upon the distraught maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet how much has been taken,&rdquo; the
girl told her excitedly. &ldquo;The rooms look as if a cyclone
had swept through them! Oh, what will the Kohls say
when they learn about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Kohl aren&rsquo;t home yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they went to the theatre. They must have
stopped at a restaurant afterwards. When they hear
of this, I&rsquo;ll lose my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Penny kindly. &ldquo;Surely you
weren&rsquo;t to blame for the burglary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think so,&rdquo; the maid responded gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Kohl. Perhaps,
if I speak a good word for you it may help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; the girl responded. &ldquo;I was supposed to
have stayed at the apartment the entire evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I went to a picture show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does throw a different light on the matter,&rdquo;
commented Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would make any difference. I intended
to get here ahead of the Kohls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The robbery occurred while you were away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. As soon as I opened the door I knew what had
happened! Oh, I&rsquo;ll lose my job all right unless I can
think up a good story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t lie if I were you,&rdquo; advised Penny. &ldquo;The
police are certain to break down your story. In any
case, you owe it to yourself and your employers to
tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A misty rain had started to fall. The maid, who was
without a wrap, shivered, yet made no move to re-enter
the building. Overhead, all along the dark expanse
of apartment wall, lights were being turned on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid your scream aroused nearly everyone
in the building,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;If I were in your place
I would return to the Kohl apartment and not answer
many questions until the police arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stay with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apartment door had slammed shut and locked
with the night latch. Fortunately the maid had a key
with her so it was not necessary to ring for the janitor.
Ignoring the persons who had gathered in the hall,
they took an automatic lift to the third floor, letting
themselves into the Kohl suite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the way I found it,&rdquo; said the maid.</p>
<p>She switched on a light, revealing a living room entirely
bare of rugs. Where three small Oriental rugs
had been placed, only rectangular rims of dirt remained
to mark their outlines.</p>
<p>Beyond, in the dining room with its massive carved
furniture, the contents of a buffet had been emptied
on the floor. Several pieces of china lay in fragments.
A corner cupboard had been stripped, save for a vase
and an ebony elephant with a broken tusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wall cabinet was filled with rare antiques,&rdquo;
disclosed the maid. &ldquo;Mrs. Kohl has collected Early
American silver for many years. Some of the pieces
she considered priceless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bedrooms were in less disorder. However, bureau
drawers had been overturned, and jewel cases
looted of everything save the most trivial articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Kohl&rsquo;s pearls are gone, and her diamond bracelet,&rdquo;
the maid informed, picking up the empty jewel
box. &ldquo;I am pretty sure she didn&rsquo;t wear them to the
theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t touch anything if I were you,&rdquo; advised
Penny. &ldquo;Fingerprints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid dropped the case. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I
never thought of that! Do you think the police will
blame me for the robbery?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you tell them the truth. It surely will be unwise
to try to hide anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hold anything back,&rdquo; the maid promised.
&ldquo;It happened just like I said. After Mr. and Mrs. Kohl
left I went to a picture show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my girl friend. After the show we had a soda
together, and then she went home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a minute or two before I called for help. I
tried the telephone first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you summon the janitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that. I was so excited I ran outside
hoping to find a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and, returning to the living room,
satisfied herself that the telephone wires actually had
been cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t notice anyone in the halls as you went
downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one. Old Mr. Veely was on the lower floor
when I came from the show, but he&rsquo;s lived here for
seven years. I don&rsquo;t see how the burglar got into the
apartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering about that myself. You&rsquo;re quite
sure you locked the suite door?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know I did,&rdquo; the maid said emphatically.
&ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t possible to get into the building without
a key. Otherwise, the janitor must be called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny walked thoughtfully to the living room window.
The apartment stood fully thirty-five feet from
a neighboring building, with the space between much
too wide to be spanned. Below, the alley was deserted,
and no fire escape ascended from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The burglar couldn&rsquo;t have entered that way,&rdquo; declared
the maid. &ldquo;He must have had his own key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny could respond, a sharp knock sounded
on the door. The servant girl turned to open it. However,
instead of the anticipated police, the apartment
janitor, George Bailey, peered into the disordered
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard someone scream a minute or so ago,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Some of the tenants thought it came from this
apartment. Maybe they were mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake,&rdquo; spoke Penny from across the
room. &ldquo;The Kohls have been robbed. Will you please
come inside and close the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed! You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; The janitor stared with
alarmed interest. &ldquo;When did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny allowed the maid to tell what had occurred,
adding no information of her own. When there came
a lull in the excited flow of words, she said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bailey, do you mind answering a few questions?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; the janitor countered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you right now I know nothing about this. I&rsquo;ve attended
strictly to my duties. It&rsquo;s not my lookout if
tenants leave their suite doors unlocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is blaming you,&rdquo; Penny assured him. &ldquo;I
merely thought you might contribute to a solution of
the burglary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a thing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t let anyone into the apartment building
tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul. I locked the service door at six o&rsquo;clock,
too. Now let me ask this: Who are you, and how did
you get in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair enough,&rdquo; smiled Penny. She told her
name, explained that she was an acquaintance of the
Kohls, and had been summoned by the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think that I am trying to play detective,&rdquo;
she added. &ldquo;I ask these questions in the hope of
gaining information for my father&rsquo;s paper, the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks to me as if it was an inside job,&rdquo; the
janitor replied, mollified. &ldquo;Come to think of it though,
I&rsquo;ve seen a suspicious-acting fellow hanging around
the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, several days ago. He stayed on the other side
of the street and kept watching the doorway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he look like, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t remember. He was just an average
young man in a gray overcoat and hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gray?&rdquo; repeated Penny alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been light blue. I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention.
At the time I sized up the fellow as a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had no opportunity to ask additional questions
for just then voices were heard in the hallway.
As she opened the door, Jerry Livingston, followed by
a policeman, came toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn anything?&rdquo; the reporter asked softly in her
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; answered Penny. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how much
the officer turns up before I go into my song and
dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making a routine inspection of the rooms, the police
questioned both the maid and the janitor. From an
elderly lady who occupied the adjoining suite he
gleaned information that the Kohls&rsquo; telephone had
rung steadily for fifteen minutes during the early evening
hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was that?&rdquo; interposed Penny.</p>
<p>The policeman gazed at her with sharp disapproval.
&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he requested with exaggerated politeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; apologized Penny, fading into the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It rang about eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; the old lady revealed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The information is not significant,&rdquo; said the officer,
glancing again at Penny.</p>
<p>She started to speak, then bit her lip, remaining
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sister, what&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; he demanded
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, officer, but I think the information does
have importance. Couldn&rsquo;t it mean that the crooks,
whoever they were, telephoned the apartment to make
certain it was deserted before breaking in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; conceded the policeman. His frown discouraged
her. &ldquo;Any other theories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Penny shortly.</p>
<p>The policeman began to herd the tenants into the
hall. For a moment he paid no attention to Penny and
Jerry, who with the maid were permitted to remain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never try to show up a policeman, even if he is a
stuffed shirt,&rdquo; remarked the reporter softly. &ldquo;It gets
you nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door closed and the officer faced the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now young lady,&rdquo; he said, quite pleasantly. &ldquo;What
do you know about this burglary? I&rsquo;ll be very glad to
listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know a thing,&rdquo; admitted Penny. &ldquo;But
here&rsquo;s a little clue which you may be able to interpret.
I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Leading the policeman to the window, she started to
raise the sash. The officer stopped her, performing the
act himself, his hand protected by a handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is your clue,&rdquo; said Penny.</p>
<p>She indicated two freshly made gashes on the window
ledge. Separated by possibly a foot of space, they
clearly had been made by a hook or sharp instrument
which had dug deeply into the wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">7</span>
<br /><i>MARK OF THE IRON HOOK</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; Penny asked as the
officer studied the marks in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say they were made by something which
hooked over the ledge,&rdquo; the policeman replied. &ldquo;Possibly
a ladder with curving irons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry gazed down over the window ledge into the
dark alley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ordinary ladder could reach this high,&rdquo; he commented.
&ldquo;Raising an extension would be quite a problem,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kohl maid timidly approached the window,
gazing at the two deep gashes with interest. Asked by
the policeman if she ever had noticed them before, she
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir. They must have been made tonight.
I know they weren&rsquo;t there this afternoon when I
dusted the window sills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Incredible as it seems, the thief came through this
window,&rdquo; decided the policeman. &ldquo;How he did it is
for the detectives at Central Station to figure out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Explaining that the rooms must not be disturbed until
Identification Bureau men had made complete
fingerprint records, the officer locked Penny, Jerry
and the maid outside the suite. He then went to a
nearby apartment to telephone his report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this is an ordinary burglary, but it doesn&rsquo;t
look that way to me,&rdquo; remarked Jerry as he and Penny
went down the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, the story should be front page copy.
Anything the Kohls do is news in Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How high would you estimate the loss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t guess, Jerry. Thousands of dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing groups of tenants who cluttered the hallway
excitedly discussing the burglary, they evaded questioners
and reached the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; said Penny suddenly, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mention this
to the policeman because he seemed to resent my
opinions. But it occurred to me that I may have seen
the man who robbed the Kohls&mdash;or at least had something
to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you have seen him, Penny? We were
together when the Kohl maid yelled for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier than that. It was while I was at the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half expecting that Jerry would laugh, Penny told
how she had observed the man in gray note down the
license number of the Kohl limousine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It came to me like a flash! That fellow may have
telephoned the Kohl apartment after seeing the car at
the theatre. Making sure no one was at home, he then
looted the place at his leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; interrupted Jerry. &ldquo;The Motor
Vehicle Department closes at six o&rsquo;clock. How could
your man have obtained Kohl&rsquo;s name and address from
the license number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought about the department being
closed,&rdquo; confessed Penny. &ldquo;How you do love to shoot
shrapnel into my little ideas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you have original theories, which is more
than I do,&rdquo; comforted Jerry. &ldquo;Before we leave, shall
we take a look at the alley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny brightened instantly and accompanied the reporter
to the rear of the building. The alley was deserted.
Without a light they were unable to examine
the ground beneath the Kohl&rsquo;s apartment window.</p>
<p>Suddenly, both straightened as they heard a sound
behind them. The brilliant beam of a flashlight focused
on their faces, blinding them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you again,&rdquo; said a gruff voice.</p>
<p>The beam was lowered, and behind it they saw the
policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young cubs are a pest,&rdquo; he said irritably.</p>
<p>Ignoring them, he moved his light over the ground.
There were no footprints or other marks visible beneath
the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If a ladder had stood here it would show,&rdquo; remarked
Jerry. &ldquo;The thief must have used some other
means of getting into the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the policeman was inspecting the ground,
the janitor stepped from a rear basement door, joining
the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officer, I have some more information for you,&rdquo; he
volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking with my wife. She says that about
two hours ago she noticed a man walking through the
alley. He carried a suitcase, and kept looking at the
upstairs windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ladder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the detectives talk with your wife,&rdquo; the
policeman promised. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here any minute
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Jerry lingered until the two men arrived,
bringing a photographer with them. No new evidence
being made available, it seemed a waste of time to remain
longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother to take me home,&rdquo; Penny insisted.
&ldquo;Dash straight to the office and write your story. The
other papers won&rsquo;t have a word about the robbery until
the police report is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to abandon you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Jerry. It&rsquo;s only a few blocks farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, the reporter bade Penny good-bye. As
she hastened on alone, it began to rain and the air
turned colder. To save her clothing, she ran the last
block, reaching the porch quite breathless.</p>
<p>The house was dark, the front door locked. Penny
let herself in with a key, switched on the lights, and
after getting a snack from the refrigerator, started upstairs.</p>
<p>From her father&rsquo;s room issued loud snores. However,
Mrs. Weems&rsquo; door stood open, and as Penny
glanced in she was surprised to see that the bed had
not been disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems must still be at the Hodges&rsquo;,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;Perhaps I should go after her. She&rsquo;ll have a
long walk in this rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went to a window and looked out. The
downpour showed no sighs of slackening. With a sigh
she found her raincoat and started for the garage.</p>
<p>During her absence, Mr. Parker had towed Leaping
Lena to a vacant lot adjoining the property. The maroon
car awaited her beneath shelter, and she drove it
through dark streets to the Hodges&rsquo; modest home.</p>
<p>Lights glowed cheerily from the lower floor windows.
In response to Penny&rsquo;s knock, a bent old man,
his hands gnarled by hard labor, opened the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Penelope?&rdquo; he asked, squinting at her through
the rain. &ldquo;Come in! Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Hodges. Is Mrs. Weems still
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, Penny,&rdquo; called the housekeeper. &ldquo;Goodness,
what time is it anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook water from her coat and stepped into
the spic and span living room. An unshaded electric
light disclosed a rug too bright, wallpaper too glaring,
furniture stiff and old fashioned. Yet one felt at once
welcome, for the seamstress and her husband were
simple, friendly people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a chair, Penelope,&rdquo; invited Mrs. Hodges. She
was short like her husband, with graying hair and an
untroubled countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I can&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I
came to drive Mrs. Weems home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea it was so late,&rdquo; the housekeeper said,
getting to her feet. &ldquo;Mrs. Hodges and I have been
planning my traveling outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to have the dresses for you within the next
two weeks,&rdquo; promised the seamstress. &ldquo;Your good fortune
makes me very happy, Maud. Isn&rsquo;t the news of
her inheritance wonderful, Penelope?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, of course,&rdquo; stammered Penny. &ldquo;Only
I hope Mrs. Weems isn&rsquo;t leaving us within two weeks.
What&rsquo;s this about a traveling outfit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted fine clothing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weems
dreamily. &ldquo;Mrs. Hodges is making me a suit, three silk
dresses, a tissue velvet evening gown&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An evening gown!&rdquo; Penny gasped. &ldquo;Where will
you wear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she aims to catch a husband while she&rsquo;s
galavantin&rsquo; around out there in Californy,&rdquo; contributed
Mr. Hodges with a sly wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very idea!&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Weems, yet with no
displeasure.</p>
<p>Penny sagged into the nearest rocking chair. The
conversation was paced too fast for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evening gowns&mdash;husbands&mdash;California,&rdquo; she murmured
weakly. &ldquo;Wait until Dad hears about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hodges was only joking,&rdquo; declared Mrs.
Weems, reaching for her hat. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t marry the
best man on earth. But I definitely am going west this
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I envy you, Maud,&rdquo; said the seamstress, her eyes
shining. &ldquo;Pa and I want to go out there and buy a little
orange grove someday. But with taxes what they are,
we can&rsquo;t seem to save a penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems squeezed her friend&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could take you along, Jenny,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;All these years you&rsquo;ve sewed your poor fingers almost
to the bone. You deserve an easier life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pa and I don&rsquo;t complain,&rdquo; the seamstress answered
brightly. &ldquo;And things are going to look up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they are,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Hodges. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a job
any day now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, who was watching the seamstress&rsquo; face was
amazed to see it suddenly transformed. Losing her
usual calm, Mrs. Hodges exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa! It just this minute came to me! Maud getting
her inheritance is another psychic sign!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny rocked violently and even Mrs. Weems
looked startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Jenny,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We said we wouldn&rsquo;t tell anybody, Ma,&rdquo; protested
Mr. Hodges mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems is my best friend, and Penelope won&rsquo;t
tell. Will you, Penelope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not what I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Penny in bewilderment.
&ldquo;How can Mrs. Weems&rsquo; inheritance have
anything to do with a psychic sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well tell &rsquo;em,&rdquo; grinned Mr. Hodges,
&ldquo;If you keep the news much longer you&rsquo;ll bust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strangest thing happened three nights ago,&rdquo;
Mrs. Hodges began, her voice quivering with excitement.
&ldquo;But wait! First I&rsquo;ll show you the letter!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>PSYCHIC SIGNS</i></h2>
<p>As Penny and Mrs. Weems waited, the seamstress
went to another room, returning with a stamped, slit
envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice the postmark,&rdquo; she requested, thrusting the
letter into Penny&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was mailed from New York,&rdquo; the girl observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the hour at which the envelope was stamped
by the postmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make it 11:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> June fifteenth,&rdquo; Penny read
aloud. &ldquo;Does the time and date have special significance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it does,&rdquo; the seamstress replied impressively.
&ldquo;You tell them, Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened three nights ago,&rdquo; began Mr. Hodges.
&ldquo;Ma worked late stitchin&rsquo; up some playsuits for Mrs.
Hudson&rsquo;s little girl. Afterwards we had bread and milk
like we always do, and then we went to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the time, I said to Pa that something queer was
going to happen,&rdquo; broke in the seamstress. &ldquo;I could
feel it in my bones. It was as if something was hovering
over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feeling of impending trouble?&rdquo; questioned
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like that,&rdquo; said Mr. Hodges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was as if one almost could feel a foreign
presence in the room,&rdquo; Mrs. Hodges declared, lowering
her voice. &ldquo;A supernatural being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts...?&rdquo; Penny
began, but the seamstress did not hear. Unheeding, she
resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa rubbed my back to ease the pain I get from
working too long at the machine. Then we went to
bed. Neither of us had gone to sleep when suddenly
we heard it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six sharp raps on the outside bedroom wall,&rdquo; supplied
Mr. Hodges. &ldquo;It was like this.&rdquo; He demonstrated
on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both heard it,&rdquo; added Mrs. Hodges. &ldquo;It scared
me nearly out of my wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly it was someone at the door,&rdquo; suggested
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t that. Pa got up and went to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it have been a tree bough brushing against
the wall?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Mr. Hodges. &ldquo;The maple is too
far off to strike our bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one explanation,&rdquo; declared the seamstress
with conviction. &ldquo;It was a psychic sign&mdash;the
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in such things myself,&rdquo; announced
Penny. &ldquo;Surely there must be another explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told Jenny,&rdquo; nodded Mr. Hodges.
&ldquo;But since the letter came, doggoned if I don&rsquo;t think
maybe she&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has the letter to do with it?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Weems.</p>
<p>The seamstress pointed to the postmark on the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hour at which we heard the strange tappings
was eleven-thirty! Pa looked at the clock. And it was
three days ago, June fifteenth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corresponding to the marking on this envelope,&rdquo;
commented Penny. &ldquo;That is a coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hodges shook her head impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t think it just happened by <i>accident</i>?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;It must have been intended as a
sign&mdash;an omen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did the letter say?&rdquo; Penny inquired, without
answering Mrs. Hodges&rsquo; question. She knew that her
true opinion would not please the woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t rightly a letter,&rdquo; the seamstress returned.
&ldquo;The envelope contained six silver dollars fitted into a
stiff piece of cardboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We figured it was another sign,&rdquo; contributed Mr.
Hodges. &ldquo;Six raps on the wall&mdash;six dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish some ghost would come and pound all night
long on my bedroom door,&rdquo; remarked Penny lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penelope, you shouldn&rsquo;t speak so disrespectfully,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems reproved in a mild voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; said Penny, composing
her face. &ldquo;What else has happened of a supernatural
nature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing yet,&rdquo; Mrs. Hodges admitted. &ldquo;But
Pa and I have had a feeling as if something important
were about to take place. And now Maud inherits six
thousand dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing psychic about that,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Weems. &ldquo;Cousin David had no close relatives so he
left the money to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seamstress shook her head, and an ethereal light
shone in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night before last when I went to bed I was thinking
that I wished with all my heart something nice
would happen to you, Maud. Now it&rsquo;s come to pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Mrs. Weems was somewhat startled by the
seamstress&rsquo; calm assumption that her thoughts had been
responsible for the inheritance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; Mrs. Hodges resumed patiently.
&ldquo;It must mean that I have great psychic powers. I confess
I am rather frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny arose and began to button her raincoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for saying it,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;but if I
were you, Mrs. Hodges, I&rsquo;d spend the six dollars and
forget the entire affair. Someone must have played a
joke on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A joke!&rdquo; The seamstress was offended. &ldquo;People
don&rsquo;t give away money as a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, these days they squeeze the eagles until they
holler,&rdquo; chuckled Mr. Hodges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter was postmarked New York City,&rdquo; went
on his wife. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know a soul there. Oh, no one
ever can make me believe that it was done as a joke.
The letter was mailed at exactly the hour we heard the
six raps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there wasn&rsquo;t a sign of anyone near the house,&rdquo;
added Mr. Hodges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at least you&rsquo;re six dollars ahead,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;Shall we go, Mrs. Weems? It&rsquo;s after midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seamstress walked to the door with the callers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get busy tomorrow on those new dresses,&rdquo; she
promised Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;Drop in again whenever you
can. And you, too, Penelope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driving home through the rain, Penny stole a quick
glance at the housekeeper who seemed unusually quiet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Jenny could be right?&rdquo; Mrs.
Weems presently ventured. &ldquo;I mean about Cousin
David and the inheritance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;Why, your
cousin died a long while before Mrs. Hodges discovered
that she was psychic. It&rsquo;s all the bunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I really knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Weems!&rdquo; Penny prepared to launch
into a violent argument. &ldquo;I never heard of such nonsense!
How could Mrs. Hodges have psychic powers?
Everyone realizes that communication with the spirit
world is impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are entitled to your opinion, Penny, but others
may differ with you. Who can know about The Life
Beyond? Isn&rsquo;t it in the realm of possibility that Mrs.
Hodges may have had a message from Cousin David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t speak of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in words, Penny. But those strange rappings,
the arrival of the letter&mdash;it was all very strange and
unexplainable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit it was queer, Mrs. Weems. However, I&rsquo;ll
never agree that there&rsquo;s anything supernatural connected
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You close your mind to things you do not wish to
believe,&rdquo; the housekeeper reproved. &ldquo;What can any of
us know of the spirit world?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Penny gazed at Mrs. Weems in alarm. She realized
that the seamstress&rsquo; story had deeply impressed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stake my knowledge against Mrs. Hodges&rsquo; any
old day,&rdquo; she declared lightly. &ldquo;I met one ghost-maker&mdash;Osandra&mdash;remember
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why remind me of that man, Penny?&rdquo; asked the
housekeeper wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you once paid him good money for the
privilege of attending his s&eacute;ances. You were convinced
he was in communication with the world beyond. He
proved to be an outrageous fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was taken in by him as were many other persons,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems acknowledged. &ldquo;Mrs. Hodges&rsquo; case is
different. We have been friends for ten years. She
would not misrepresent the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Hodges is honest. I believe that the money
was sent to her. But not by a ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not discuss it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weems with finality.
&ldquo;I never did enjoy an argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny lapsed into silence and a moment later the
car swung into the Parker driveway. The housekeeper
hurried into the house, leaving the girl to close the
garage doors.</p>
<p>Penny snapped the padlock shut. Unmindful of the
rain, she stood for a moment, staring into the night.
Nothing had gone exactly right that day, and her disagreement
with Mrs. Weems, minor though it was,
bothered her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to this psychic business than appears
on the surface,&rdquo; she thought grimly. &ldquo;A great deal
more! Maybe I am stubborn and opinionated. But I
know one thing! No trickster is going to take advantage
of the Hodges or of Mrs. Weems either&mdash;not if I
can prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>MRS. WEEMS&rsquo; INHERITANCE</i></h2>
<p>The clock chimed seven-thirty the next morning
as Penny came downstairs. She dropped a kiss on her
father&rsquo;s forehead and slid into a chair at the opposite
side of the breakfast table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Daddykins,&rdquo; she greeted him cheerfully.
&ldquo;Any news in the old scandal sheet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker lowered the newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t call me Daddykins,&rdquo; he requested.
&ldquo;You know I hate it. Here&rsquo;s something which may interest
you. Your friends the Kohls were robbed last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re eight hours late,&rdquo; grinned Penny, reaching
for the front page. &ldquo;I was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you lifted the pearls and the diamond
bracelet on your way to the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Penny, rapidly scanning the story which
Jerry had written, &ldquo;but I think I may have seen the
man who did do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>She then told her father of having observed a stranger
note the license number of the Kohl car, and mentioned
the events which had followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have been mistaken about what the man
wrote down,&rdquo; commented her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible, but he was staring straight at the
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if the incident had any connection with the
burglary, Penny. With the Motor Vehicle Department
closed, he would have had no means of quickly learning
who the Kohls were or where they lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he have recognized them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case he would have no need for the license
number. You didn&rsquo;t see the man note down the plates
of other cars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he may have done it before I noticed him
standing by the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning idly through the morning paper, Penny&rsquo;s
attention was drawn to another news story. Reading it
rapidly, she thrust the page into her father&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, look at this! There were two other burglaries
last night! Apartment houses on Drexel Boulevard and
Fenmore Street were entered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-m, interesting. The Kohls occupy an apartment
also. That rather suggests that the same thief ransacked
the three places.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it says here that the families were away for
the evening!&rdquo; Penny resumed with increasing excitement.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cent they were at the theatre! Oh,
Dad, that man in gray must have been the one who
did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all the persons you suspect of crime were arrested,
our jails couldn&rsquo;t hold them,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Parker calmly. &ldquo;Eat your breakfast, Penny, before it
gets cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems entered through the kitchen door,
bearing reenforcements of hot waffles and crisp bacon.
Her appearance reminded Penny to launch into a
highly entertaining account of all that had transpired
at the Hodges&rsquo; the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny!&rdquo; protested the housekeeper. &ldquo;You promised
Mrs. Hodges to say nothing about the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I didn&rsquo;t promise,&rdquo; corrected Penny. &ldquo;I was
careful to say that I couldn&rsquo;t tell what I didn&rsquo;t know.
Years ago Dad taught me that a good reporter never
agrees to accept a confidence. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wise reporter never ties his own hands,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Parker. &ldquo;If he promises, and then obtains the
same story from another source, he&rsquo;s morally bound
not to use it. His paper may be scooped by the opposition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You two are a pair,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;Scoops
and front page stories are all either of you think about.
I declare, it distresses me to realize how Penny may be
trained after I leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way to solve that problem is not to leave,&rdquo;
said Penny. &ldquo;You know we can&rsquo;t get along without
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cuts me almost in two to leave,&rdquo; she declared
sadly, &ldquo;but my mind&rsquo;s made up. Mrs. Hodges says I
am doing the right thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose a ghost advised her,&rdquo; muttered
Penny.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker glanced sternly at his daughter and she
subsided into silence. But not for long. Soon she was
trying to reopen the subject of the mysterious letter
received by the Hodges. For a reason she could not
understand, her father was loath to discuss it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Penny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re having that game
of tennis this morning, it&rsquo;s time we start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>En route to the park, the publisher explained why
he had not chosen to express an opinion in the housekeeper&rsquo;s
presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you that Mrs. Hodges has no
psychic powers, Penny. She&rsquo;s been the victim of a
hoax. However, Mrs. Weems is intensely loyal to her
friend, and any disparaging remarks made by us will
only serve to antagonize her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to be more careful, Dad. But it&rsquo;s so silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday morning found Penny busy once more with
her duties at the society desk. No new information had
developed regarding the Kohl burglary, and she did
not have time to accompany Mrs. Weems who went
frequently to the Hodges&rsquo; cottage.</p>
<p>Secretly Penny held an opinion that the housekeeper&rsquo;s
inheritance might be the work of a prankster.
Therefore, upon returning from the office one afternoon
and learning that the money actually had been
delivered, she was very glad she had kept her thoughts
to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lawyer came this morning and had me sign a
paper,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems revealed to the Parkers. &ldquo;Then
he turned the money over to me&mdash;six thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the cheque is good,&rdquo; remarked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was. I had the lawyer accompany me to the
bank. They gave me the money without asking a
single question. I have it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have six thousand dollars cash in the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had the cashier give it to me in hundred dollar
bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you consider it safe to keep such a large sum?&rdquo;
Mr. Parker inquired mildly. &ldquo;I should advise returning
it to the bank, or better still, why not invest it in
sound securities?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Mrs. Weems shook her head. &ldquo;It gives me a nice rich
feeling to have the cash. I&rsquo;ve hidden it in a good place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; demanded Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>Again later in the evening, Mr. Parker tried without
success to convince the housekeeper that she should
return the money to a bank. Never one to force his
opinions upon another, he then dropped the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you be leaving us, Mrs. Weems?&rdquo; he
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you can spare me. Now that I have the
money, I should like to leave within ten days or two
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we can&rsquo;t persuade you to remain, I&rsquo;ll try to
find someone to take your place,&rdquo; Mr. Parker promised.</p>
<p>Both he and Penny were gloomy at the prospect of
replacing the housekeeper. Not only would they miss
Mrs. Weems but they honestly believed that she would
never be happy without two incorrigibles and a home
to manage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Penny ventured when they were alone, &ldquo;just
supposing that Mrs. Weems&rsquo; money should mysteriously
disappear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t allow your mind to dwell on that idea,&rdquo; cut
in her father sternly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll play fair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Penny hastily. &ldquo;I was
only joking. But if something <i>should</i> happen to the
money, it would solve all our problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems has earned her vacation. Even though
it will be hard to lose her, we mustn&rsquo;t stand in her
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; sighed Penny.</p>
<p>The following day Miss Hilderman resumed her
duties at the <i>Star</i>, and Penny once more found herself
a person of leisure. To her annoyance, Mrs. Weems
insisted that she spend many hours in the kitchen,
learning how to bake pies and cakes. A particularly
distasteful lesson came to an end only when Penny,
with brilliant inspiration, remembered that the housekeeper
had an appointment with the seamstress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I had forgotten it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Weems. &ldquo;Yes, I must try on my new dresses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive you over,&rdquo; offered Penny.</p>
<p>Not in recent days had the girl called upon the
Hodges. As she and Mrs. Weems alighted from the
car, they both noticed freshly ironed curtains at the
windows. Mr. Hodges was pounding dust from a
carpet on the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Housecleaning?&rdquo; inquired Penny, pausing to chat
with the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jenny&rsquo;s got me hard at it,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
been tearin&rsquo; the house upside down gettin&rsquo; ready for
the new roomer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have you taken one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was surprised, knowing that in past years the
Hodges had been too proud to rent rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a young feller moving in today,&rdquo; Mr.
Hodges said, picking up the carpet beater. &ldquo;Go on
inside. Jenny&rsquo;ll tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Mrs. Weems entered the cottage where
the seamstress was running a dust mop over the floors.
She was somewhat dismayed to see the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Maud, I&rsquo;ve been so busy I didn&rsquo;t get your
dresses ready to be tried on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
this about a new roomer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always said I wouldn&rsquo;t have one cluttering up the
place. But this young man is different. His coming
here&mdash;well, I interpret it as another sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sign of what?&rdquo; inquired Penny with her usual
directness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seemed as if I had a direct message from
the spirit world to take him into our home. He came
here last night. Instead of knocking in the usual way,
he rapped six times in succession!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he was the one who sent the letter,&rdquo; said
Penny alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! He didn&rsquo;t know anything about it. I asked
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his name, Mrs. Hodges?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Al Gepper. He&rsquo;s such a nice young man and he
talks so refined. I am letting him have the entire floor
upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should bring you a nice income,&rdquo; remarked
Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am asking only two dollars a week,&rdquo; admitted
the seamstress. &ldquo;He said he couldn&rsquo;t pay more than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jenny,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Weems, &ldquo;such a
small amount hardly will cover the lights and various
extras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Maud, but I couldn&rsquo;t turn him away. He
moved his apparatus in last night and will bring his
personal belongings sometime today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His apparatus?&rdquo; echoed Penny. &ldquo;What is he, a
chemist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the seamstress, smiling mysteriously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Mrs. Weems followed the woman upstairs.
The upper floor was divided into two small bedrooms
with a wide, old-fashioned sliding door between
which could be opened to make one large chamber.
The larger of the rooms had been cleared of its usual
furniture. Where a bed previously had stood was a
circular table with six or eight chairs, and behind it a
tall cabinet with a black curtain across the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gepper plans to use this room for his studio,&rdquo;
explained Mrs. Hodges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s gaze had fastened upon the cabinet. She
crossed to it and pulled aside the curtain. Inside were
several unpacked boxes and a suitcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hodges, to what purpose does your young
man expect to put this studio?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He didn&rsquo;t tell me. But I think he intends
to carry on psychic experiments. He&rsquo;s a student,
he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gepper was afraid to tell you the truth lest
you refuse to rent the rooms,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;Mrs.
Hodges, your roomer is a medium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve seen trappings such as these before at
other s&eacute;ance chambers,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;Mrs. Hodges,
you must send him away before he involves you with
the police.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>OUIJA BOARD WISDOM</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble with the police!&rdquo; Mrs. Hodges echoed,
regarding Penny with unconcealed dismay. &ldquo;How
can it be illegal to rent Mr. Gepper these rooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renting the rooms isn&rsquo;t illegal,&rdquo; Penny corrected.
&ldquo;But if the young man conducts public s&eacute;ances here&mdash;filches
money from people&mdash;then you may be considered
a party to the scheme. This city has a local
ordinance prohibiting fortune telling, mind reading
and the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure the young man means no wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Weems, &ldquo;it seems to me
that you are overly concerned. Why are you convinced
that Mr. Gepper is a medium?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t this cabinet indicate it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was some sort of wardrobe closet,&rdquo;
Mrs. Hodges admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Al Gepper is a medium, or pretends to have spiritualistic
powers,&rdquo; Penny repeated. &ldquo;In my opinion
you&rsquo;ll be very unwise to allow him to start an illegal
business here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I don&rsquo;t know what to do now,&rdquo; declared
the seamstress. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ask Pa about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She and Mrs. Weems started downstairs, expecting
that Penny would follow. Instead, the girl lingered to
inspect the cabinet.</p>
<p>On the lower floor a door slammed, and there were
footsteps ascending the stairway. She paid no heed,
assuming that it was either Mr. Hodges or his wife
who approached.</p>
<p>The door swung open. Turning, Penny saw a young
man, possibly thirty years of age, standing on the
threshold. His dark eyes were sharp and appraising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said, without smiling. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
afraid a monkey may jump out of that cabinet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, who seldom blushed, felt a wave of heat
creeping over her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;You must be Mrs. Hodges&rsquo;
new roomer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al Gepper, at your service. Who are you, girlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guessed it,&rdquo; said Penny shortly, edging away
from the cabinet.</p>
<p>Al Gepper remained in the doorway, blocking the
exit with his arm. He did not move as the girl attempted
to move past him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your hurry?&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;Stick around
and let&rsquo;s get acquainted. I&rsquo;ll show you some neat card
tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I haven&rsquo;t time, Mr. Gepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name anyhow?&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not Mrs. Hodges&rsquo; daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be so icy about it,&rdquo; he rebuked. &ldquo;Any
friend of Mrs. Hodges&rsquo; is a friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never make friends easily,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;For
that matter, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I have advised
Mrs. Hodges not to rent you these rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have?&rdquo; inquired the man, his eyes hardening.
&ldquo;And what business is it of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, perhaps. I merely am not going to allow her
to be taken in if I can prevent it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed. Do you mind explaining?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious that you&rsquo;re one of these fake
spiritualists,&rdquo; Penny accused bluntly. &ldquo;Your nickname
should be Six-Raps Al!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little spit-fire, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the man retorted.
&ldquo;But you have style. Now I may be able to use you in
my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admit that you&rsquo;re a medium?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a spiritualist. Not a fake, as you so crudely
accuse. And I assure you I have no intention of deceiving
or taking advantage of your dear friends, the
Hodges.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You expect to use these rooms for public s&eacute;ances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are certain to get the Hodges into trouble
with the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you start squawking.&rdquo; Al Gepper&rsquo;s
manner changed abruptly. He grasped Penny&rsquo;s wrist
and pushed a leering face close to hers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking
for any trouble from you or anyone else&mdash;see! If
you try to make it, you&rsquo;ll wake up with a headache!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny jerked free and, shouldering through the
door, raced downstairs.</p>
<p>Glancing back, she saw that Al Gepper was following,
though at a more leisurely pace. Instantly she divined
that he intended to make sure no report of the
incident was given to the Hodges, save in his presence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems and the old couple were talking in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ma, it&rsquo;s for you to decide,&rdquo; Mr. Hodges was
saying. &ldquo;We gave our word to the young feller, and
it&rsquo;s kinda mean to turn him out so sudden like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret Penny said anything about the matter.&rdquo;
apologized Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;You know how out-spoken
and impulsive she is. Of course, she has no information
about Mr. Gepper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I do have information,&rdquo; spoke Penny from
the doorway. &ldquo;Mr. Gepper has just admitted that he
intends to use the room for public s&eacute;ances. Isn&rsquo;t that
true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Defiantly, she turned to face the young man who
had followed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; he acknowledged loftily. &ldquo;One who
has a great psychic gift is duty-bound to allow the
world to benefit from one&rsquo;s talents. The selection of
this house as a Temple for Celestial Communication
was not mine, but the bidding of the Spirits. In a
dream I was instructed to come here and take up residence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What night did you have the dream?&rdquo; questioned
Mrs. Hodges, deeply impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was June fifteenth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very night we heard the strange rappings on
our bedroom wall, Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogonned if it wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gepper, do you truly believe it is possible to
communicate with the spiritual world?&rdquo; Mrs. Weems
inquired politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear madam, I can best answer by offering a
demonstration. Have you a ouija board in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have,&rdquo; spoke Mrs. Hodges eagerly. &ldquo;Pa
and I got it from a mail order house years ago, but it
never worked for us. You fetch it, Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Mr. Hodges brought a large, flat board which
bore letters and figures. Upon it he placed a small, triangular
piece with cushioned legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This do-dad is supposed to spell out messages, ain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Ma and I could never make it work
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al Gepper smiled in a superior way, and placing the
board on his lap, motioned for Mrs. Weems to sit opposite
him. However, before the housekeeper could
obey, Penny slid into the vacant chair. The medium
frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Place your hands lightly on the triangular piece,&rdquo;
he instructed. &ldquo;Concentrate with me as we await a
message from the spiritual world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny fastened her eyes on the distant wall with a
blank stare.</p>
<p>A minute passed. The ouija board made several convulsive
struggles, but seemed unable to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spirits encounter resistance,&rdquo; the medium said
testily. &ldquo;They can send no message when one&rsquo;s attitude
is antagonistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I take off the brakes?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>Even as she spoke the pointer of the triangle began
moving, rapidly spelling a message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AL GEPPER IS A FRAUD,&rdquo; it wrote.</p>
<p>The medium sprang to his feet, allowing the board
to fall from his lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pushed it!&rdquo; he accused. &ldquo;The test was unfair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the very idea,&rdquo; chuckled Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, please allow Mr. Gepper to conduct a true
test,&rdquo; reproved Mrs. Weems severely. &ldquo;Let me try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al Gepper, however, would have no more of the
ouija board. Instead, he took a pad of white paper
from his pocket. Seating Mrs. Weems at the kitchen
table he requested her to write a message, which, without
being shown to anyone in the room, was sealed in
an envelope.</p>
<p>The medium pointedly requested Penny to examine
the envelope to assure herself the writing could not be
seen through the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are satisfied that I have not read the message?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Penny admitted reluctantly.</p>
<p>The medium took the envelope, ran his fingers
lightly over it, and returned it still sealed to Mrs.
Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am not mistaken, Madam, you wrote, &lsquo;Is the
spirit of my cousin in this room?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I did!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;Those were
the exact words! How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al Gepper smiled mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen nothing, Madam,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now if
conditions are right, it may be possible for us to learn
if a Spirit has joined our group. Lower the blinds,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Mr. Hodges hastened to obey. With the kitchen in
semi-darkness, the medium motioned for his audience
to move a few paces away. Taking his own position
behind the kitchen table, he intoned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Spirit, if you are with us in the room, signal
by lifting this piece of furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the man moved his hands above the table.
At first nothing happened, then to the astonishment
of his audience, it lifted a few inches from the floor.
There it hung suspended a moment before dropping
into place again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; With a triumphant ring to his voice, the
medium crossed the room to raise the window shades.
&ldquo;Now do you doubt me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hodges tremulously. &ldquo;Only
a Spirit could have moved that table. Maud, perhaps
it <i>was</i> your Cousin David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The medium gazed at Mrs. Weems with sympathetic
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have lost a loved one recently?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousin David and I never were well acquainted,&rdquo;
replied the housekeeper. &ldquo;That was why I was so surprised
when he left me an inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems!&rdquo; remonstrated Penny. She was dismayed
by the revelation so casually offered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you would like to communicate with
your departed cousin at some later time,&rdquo; the medium
said smoothly. &ldquo;Allow me to offer my services as an
intermediary. No charge, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s very generous of you, Mr. Gepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. Friends of the Hodges are my friends.
Shall we set a definite date&mdash;say tomorrow at two
o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll come. That is, if the Hodges are to be
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly. Mrs. Hodges is definitely psychic and
should contribute to our s&eacute;ance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with the greatest of difficulty that Penny
finally induced the housekeeper to leave the cottage.
Al Gepper accompanied them to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow at two,&rdquo; he repeated, smiling slyly at
Penny. &ldquo;And you may come also, my little doubter. I
assure you it will be well worth your time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>

<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>THE CELESTIAL TEMPLE</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, tell me the truth,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems urged
as they drove home together. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you push the
ouija board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;But if I hadn&rsquo;t, Al
Gepper would have. He was trying hard enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said you were resisting the spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the worst sort of nonsense,&rdquo; Penny returned
impatiently. &ldquo;Gepper is a fraud, and I wish you
hadn&rsquo;t told him about your inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you accuse him of being a fraud after
you saw his marvelous demonstration? The table actually
rose from the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it did,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged unwillingly.
&ldquo;But it must have been trickery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it have been? The table was an ordinary
one. Mrs. Hodges uses it every day of her life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he did it,&rdquo; Penny responded.
&ldquo;All the same, I am sure he&rsquo;s a trickster. Promise me
you won&rsquo;t tell him anything more about yourself or
the inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll promise if it gives you satisfaction,&rdquo;
the housekeeper replied. &ldquo;However, I do intend to
keep my appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had no opportunity to relate to her father
what had occurred at the Hodges home, for Mr. Parker
was absent on a two-day business trip to a distant
town. Feeling that she must tell someone, she sought
Louise Sidell, and they discussed every angle of the
affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you attend the s&eacute;ance with Mrs. Weems?&rdquo;
Louise asked her curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I?&rdquo; Penny repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right there with
bells! I intend to expose Mr. Al Gepper if it&rsquo;s the last
act of my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning home later in the afternoon, she found
Mrs. Weems sitting on the living room floor, sorting a
drawer of old photographs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not packing your things already?&rdquo; Penny
asked in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only these photographs,&rdquo; the housekeeper responded.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have started the task, only I got
into it when the agent came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man from the Clamont Photograph Studio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s opening this week. They&rsquo;re having a special
offer&mdash;three old photographs enlarged for only
twenty-five cents. I gave the man Cousin David&rsquo;s picture
and two others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a bargain,&rdquo; remarked Penny. &ldquo;I wish I had
been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening meal was served, and afterwards Mrs.
Weems devoted herself to the reading of travel books
borrowed from the library. Penny could find no occupation
to satisfy her. She turned the radio on, switched
it off again, and wandered restlessly from room to
room. Finally she went to the telephone and called
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a little adventure?&rdquo; she proposed. &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t ask for explanations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we be home by ten o&rsquo;clock? That&rsquo;s the
parental deadline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;ll make it easily. Meet me at the corner
of Carabel and Clinton Streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems was so engrossed in her book that she
merely nodded as Penny explained that she and Louise
were going for a walk. Reaching the appointed corner
the girl found her chum awaiting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about this so-called adventure,&rdquo; she commanded.
&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To the Celestial Temple, Lou. At least, we&rsquo;ll look
at it from the outside. Meetings are held there nearly
every night at eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, I don&rsquo;t think I care to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! The meetings are open to the public,
aren&rsquo;t they? We&rsquo;ll have a very interesting time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Louise consented reluctantly. &ldquo;But
I can&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re so interested in the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls took a bus to the end of the line, then
walked three blocks until they came to Butternut
Lane. For long stretches there were only scattered
houses and the street lamps were far between. Becoming
increasingly uneasy, Louise urged her chum to
turn back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re at our destination now,&rdquo; Penny protested.
&ldquo;I am sure that must be the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to an old, rectangular brick structure
only a few yards ahead. Obviously it once had been a
church for there was a high bell tower, and behind the
building a cluster of neglected tombstones gleamed in
the moonlight.</p>
<p>The evenly spaced windows were illuminated, and
music could be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure this is the place?&rdquo; Louise inquired
dubiously. &ldquo;It looks like a church to me, and they&rsquo;re
holding a service.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the building hasn&rsquo;t been used for such purposes
in over fifteen years,&rdquo; Penny explained. &ldquo;I investigated,
so I know its history. Until three years ago it was
used as a county fire station. Only recently it was reclaimed
by this Omar Society of Celestial Thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls moved closer. Through an open window
they were able to see fifteen or twenty people seated
in the pews. A woman played a wheezing organ while
a man led the off-key singing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go inside,&rdquo; Penny proposed.</p>
<p>Louise held back. &ldquo;Oh, no, we can see everything
from here. It looks as if it were a very stupid sort of
meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appearances are often deceiving. I want a ringside
seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny pulled her chum toward the entrance door.
There they hesitated, reading a large placard which
bore the invitation:</p>
<p><i>The Public Is Invited. Services at eight p.m. daily.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re part of the public, Lou,&rdquo; urged Penny.
&ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She boldly opened the door, and there was no retreat.</p>
<p>Heads turned slightly as the girls entered the rear of
the Temple. As quickly they turned forward again,
but not before Penny had gained an impression, of
sharp, appraising faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>A man arose, bowed, and offered the girls his bench,
although many others were available. They slipped
into the pew, accepting a song book which was placed
in Louise&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>While her chum sang in a thin, squeaky voice,
Penny allowed her gaze to wander over the room. At
the far end she saw a door which apparently opened
into the bell tower. On a slightly raised platform where
the leader stood, were two black-draped cabinets somewhat
similar to the one she had seen at Mrs. Hodges&rsquo;
cottage. Otherwise, there was nothing of unusual interest.</p>
<p>The services were decorous to the point of being
boring. Yet as the meeting went on, Penny and Louise
both felt that they were being studied. More than once
they surprised persons gazing at them.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the session which lasted no
longer than thirty minutes, the leader asked the audience
if any &ldquo;brother&rdquo; were present who wished to
attempt a spirit communication. Immediately, Penny
sat up a bit straighter, anticipating that interesting
demonstrations were in store.</p>
<p>Nor was she mistaken. A thin, hard-faced man went
to the rostrum, and in a loud voice began to call upon
the spirits to make known their presence. Signs were
at once forthcoming. The empty pews began to dance
as if alive. The speaker&rsquo;s table lifted a foot from the
floor and a pitcher of water fell from it, smashing into
a dozen pieces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Louise, her eyes dilated with fear, edged closer to
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>Penny shook her head.</p>
<p>A woman dressed in blue silk glided down the aisle,
stopping beside the girls. She held a tray upon which
were a number of objects, an opal ring, a knife, and
several pins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearie,&rdquo; she said to Penny, &ldquo;if you would care to
have a message from a departed soul, place a trinket in
this collection. Any personal object. Our leader will
then exhort the spirit to appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Louise, without giving
her chum a chance to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, you would prefer a private reading,&rdquo; the
woman murmured. &ldquo;I give them at my home, and the
fee is trivial. Only a dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no,&rdquo; Louise repeated firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shrugged and moved on down the aisle,
pausing beside an elderly man to whom she addressed
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, why did you discourage her?&rdquo; Penny whispered.
&ldquo;We might have learned something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned quite enough. I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Louise squeezed past her chum, heading for the
exit. Penny had no choice but to follow.</p>
<p>Before they could reach the door, it suddenly
opened from the outside. A young man who had not
bothered to remove his hat, entered. Seeing the girls,
he abruptly halted, then turned and retreated.</p>
<p>Penny quickened her step. Taking Louise&rsquo;s hand she
pulled her along at a faster pace. They reached the
vestibule. It was deserted. Penny peered up and down
the dark street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Louise questioned in a puzzled voice. &ldquo;You
mean that man who entered the Temple and then
left so suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; responded Penny. &ldquo;Unless my eyes tricked
me, he was none other than Al Gepper!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>A MESSAGE FOR MRS. WEEMS</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anyone answering to that name,&rdquo;
remarked Louise. &ldquo;However, the fellow did act as if
he were retreating from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced up and down the dark street. No
one was to be seen, and since so little time had elapsed,
she reasoned that the man had taken refuge either in
the high weeds or the nearby cemetery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Gepper,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Naturally
he wouldn&rsquo;t care to meet me here.&rdquo; Quickly
Penny recounted the events of the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think he may be connected with the
Temple, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be my guess. Lou, this place is nothing
but a blind. The members of the society pretend to be
honest spiritualists, while in reality they&rsquo;re charlatans.
They hold services for one purpose only&mdash;to solicit
persons for private readings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that illegal?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is. The police should raid the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t they, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad says it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve been unable to obtain
sufficient evidence. But they&rsquo;ll have it after we report
what we&rsquo;ve seen tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you suppose they made things jump
around as if they were alive?&rdquo; Louise remarked as the
girls walked slowly toward home. &ldquo;It frightened me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything was done by trickery. I&rsquo;m sure of that,
Lou. Just as soon as Dad returns I shall make a full report
to him. We&rsquo;ll see what he can do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time Penny arrived home, Mrs. Weems had
retired to her room. However, the light still burned
and the door was open a crack. Rapping, the girl entered,
for she was eager to tell the housekeeper about
her visit to the Celestial Temple.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems sat at the desk. Hastily she closed one
of the drawers, and turned the key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You startled me, Penny!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I do
wish you would give more warning before you descend
upon one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; apologized Penny, glancing curiously toward
the desk. &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see what?&rdquo; demanded the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six thousand dollars reposing in a desk drawer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems&rsquo; look of consternation betrayed her.
She glanced at the locked drawer, and then laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For an instant I thought you actually could see
the money, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then my guess was right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep the money in the drawer,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems
admitted.</p>
<p>Penny sat down on the edge of the bed, drawing
up her knees for a chin rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s risky keeping so
much money here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will only be for a few days, Penny. I&rsquo;ll have it
converted into traveler&rsquo;s cheques as soon as I am ready
to start west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The desk doesn&rsquo;t seem a safe place to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only person who knows where I keep
the money, Penny. Oh, yes, I told Mrs. Hodges, but
she is to be trusted. No one can steal it as long as I
have the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems tapped a black velvet ribbon which
she wore about her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep this on me day and night,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;No
thief ever will get it way from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny said nothing more about the matter. Instead,
she launched into a highly colored account of her visit
to the Celestial Temple. The housekeeper expressed
disapproval, remarking that she never would have
granted permission had she known in advance where
the girls were going. Nevertheless, her eager questions
made it evident that she was deeply interested in the
demonstration which had been witnessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can call it trickery,&rdquo; she protested.
&ldquo;You have no proof, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never in the world will I believe that spirits can
make tables do a dance, Mrs. Weems! Probably the
furniture had special wiring or something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that about the table at Mrs. Hodges&rsquo;,
Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it seemed to be just an ordinary piece of furniture,&rdquo;
the girl admitted reluctantly. &ldquo;All the same, Al
Gepper is a fraud, and I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t attend his
old s&eacute;ance tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Penny, I gave my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can run over to the house and tell him you&rsquo;ve
changed your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems shook her head. &ldquo;No, Penny, I am
curious to learn if he will be able to communicate
with the spirits. Tomorrow&rsquo;s s&eacute;ance should provide a
genuine test. The man knows nothing about me or my
ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hodges probably has provided all the information
he&rsquo;ll require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I telephoned her yesterday and requested her not
to tell Mr. Gepper anything about me. She&rsquo;ll respect
my wishes. The test should prove a true one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Penny sighed and arose from the bed. Knowing
Mrs. Weems as she did, she realized that her opinion
could not be changed by argument. It was her hope
that Al Gepper would discredit himself by failing in
the s&eacute;ance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, please promise that you&rsquo;ll do nothing outrageous
tomorrow,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems begged as the girl
started to leave. &ldquo;I am sure Mr. Gepper feels that you
are antagonistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to behave myself,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;Yes,
we&rsquo;ll give Mr. Gepper a chance to prove what he can
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At two the following afternoon she and Mrs.
Weems presented themselves at the Hodges&rsquo; cottage.
Both Mr. Hodges and his wife, who were to sit in at
the s&eacute;ance, were trembling with anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gepper is simply wonderful,&rdquo; the seamstress
confided to Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;He tells me that I have
great healing powers as well as a psychic personality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, I hope you haven&rsquo;t told him anything
about me,&rdquo; the housekeeper mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Maud. For that matter, he&rsquo;s said nothing
about you since you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems cast Penny an &ldquo;I-told-you-so&rdquo; glance
which was not lost upon Al Gepper who entered the
room at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready for you, ladies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Kindly follow
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>In the upstairs room blinds had been drawn. Al
Gepper indicated that his audience was to occupy the
chairs around the circular table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we attempt to communicate with the departed
souls, I wish to assure you that I employ no
trickery,&rdquo; he announced, looking hard at Penny. &ldquo;You
may examine the table or the cabinet if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mr. Gepper,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Hodges.
&ldquo;We trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Penny.</p>
<p>She peered beneath the table, thumped it several
times, and pulled aside the curtain of the cabinet. It
was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if you are quite satisfied, shall we begin?&rdquo;
purred Mr. Gepper. &ldquo;It will make it much easier, if
each one of you will give me a personal object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A la the Celestial Temple method,&rdquo; muttered
Penny beneath her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; questioned the medium sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. I was merely thinking to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then please think more quietly. I must warn you
that this s&eacute;ance cannot be successful unless each person
present concentrates, entering into the occasion
with the deepest of sincerity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, I am as sincere as yourself,&rdquo; Penny
responded gravely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Mr. Hodges deposited his gold watch on the table.
His wife offered a pin and Mrs. Weems a plain band
ring. Penny parted with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>After everyone was seated about the table, Al
Gepper played several phonograph records, all the
while exhorting the Spirits to appear.</p>
<p>Taking Mrs. Weems&rsquo; ring from the tray before him,
he pressed it to his forehead. A convulsive shudder
wracked his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone comes to me&mdash;&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Someone
comes, giving the name of David&mdash;David Swester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin,&rdquo; breathed Mrs. Weems in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is tall and dark with a scar over his left eye,&rdquo;
resumed the medium. &ldquo;I see him plainly now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>is</i> David!&rdquo; cried the housekeeper, leaning
forward in her eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, have you a message for us?&rdquo; the medium
intoned.</p>
<p>There was a long silence, during which the man
could be seen writhing and twisting in the semi-darkness.
Then his voice began again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;David has a message for a person called Maud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Maud,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weems tremulously. &ldquo;Oh,
what does he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he is well and happy in the Spirit World, but
he is worried about Maud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worried about me? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>The medium again seemed to undergo physical suffering,
but presently the message &ldquo;came through,&rdquo; although
not in an entirely clear form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David&rsquo;s voice has faded. I am not certain, but it has
something to do with six thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The exact amount he left to me!&rdquo; Mrs. Weems
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David is afraid that you will not have the wisdom
to invest the money wisely. He warns you that the
present place where you have it deposited is not safe.
He will tell you what to do with it. Now the voice is
fading again. David has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With another convulsive shudder, Al Gepper
straightened from the position into which he had
slumped. Resuming his normal tone he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all. The connection with Cousin David has
been broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we contact him again?&rdquo; Mrs. Weems asked
in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not today. Possibly tomorrow at this same hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you call up another Spirit by using my
pin or Pa&rsquo;s watch?&rdquo; Mrs. Hodges suggested wistfully.</p>
<p>Al Gepper raised one of the window blinds. &ldquo;I am
very, very tired,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This s&eacute;ance was particularly
exhausting due to the presence of someone antagonistic.
Tomorrow if conditions are right, I hope
actually to materialize Cousin David. The poor soul
is trying so hard to get a message through to the one
he calls Maud.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;ll be able to see him?&rdquo; the housekeeper
asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope and believe so. I must rest now. After a
s&eacute;ance I should refresh myself with sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Hodges. &ldquo;We are selfish
to overtax you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recovering their trinkets, the elderly couple and
Mrs. Weems went from the room. Penny was the last
to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sister?&rdquo; inquired the medium in a low voice.
&ldquo;Were you convinced, or do you still think that you
can show up Al Gepper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Penny softly, &ldquo;that you are a very
clever man. But clever as you are, one of your well-trained
ghosts may yet lead you to the city jail!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>COUSIN DAVID&rsquo;S GHOST</i></h2>
<p>When Penny reached the lower floor she found
Mrs. Weems and the Hodges excitedly discussing the
s&eacute;ance. The seamstress and her husband emphatically
declared that they had given the medium no information
regarding either the housekeeper or the deceased
Cousin David.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there can be only one explanation,&rdquo; Mrs.
Weems said. &ldquo;We were truly in communication with
a departed spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you agree, Penny?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Hodges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The test was a fair one,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems insisted.
&ldquo;Mr. Gepper couldn&rsquo;t have described Cousin David
so accurately if he hadn&rsquo;t actually seen him as he materialized
from the spirit world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al Gepper could have obtained much of his information
from persons in Riverview,&rdquo; Penny responded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About me, perhaps,&rdquo; the housekeeper conceded.
&ldquo;But not about Cousin David. Why, I doubt if anyone
save myself knew he had a scar over his eye. He received
it in an automobile accident twelve or thirteen
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Hodges. &ldquo;Tomorrow
you may actually be able to see your departed cousin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In vain Penny argued that Al Gepper was a trickster.
She was unable to offer the slightest evidence to
support her contention while, on the other hand, the
Hodges reminded her that the medium had never
asked one penny for his services.</p>
<p>From the cottage Penny went directly to the <i>Star</i>
office, feeling certain that her father would have returned
there from his trip. Nor was she mistaken.
Gaining admittance to the private office, she wasted no
words in relating everything which had transpired
during his absence. Her father&rsquo;s attention was flattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you actually saw all this?&rdquo; he questioned
when she had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! At the Celestial Temple Louise was with
me, too. We thought you might take up the matter
with the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I will do,&rdquo; decided Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve turned the matter over in my mind for several
days. The <i>Star</i> will take the initiative in driving these
mediums, character readers and the like out of Riverview!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, I was hoping you&rsquo;d say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker pressed a desk buzzer. Summoning DeWitt,
he told of his plan to launch an active campaign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing will please me better, Chief,&rdquo; responded
the city editor. &ldquo;Where do we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tip the police to what is going on at the
Celestial Temple. Have them send detectives there for
tonight&rsquo;s meeting. Then when the usual hocus-pocus
starts, arrests can be made. Have photographers and a
good reporter on hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should start the ball rolling,&rdquo; agreed DeWitt.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll assign Jerry Livingston to the story. Salt Sommers
is my best photographer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get busy right away,&rdquo; Mr. Parker ordered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
play the story big tomorrow&mdash;give it a spread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Al Gepper?&rdquo; Penny inquired after DeWitt
had gone. &ldquo;Could he be arrested without involving
the Hodges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very easily if he lives at their place. Has he accepted
money for the s&eacute;ances he conducts there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t taken any yet from Mrs. Weems. I am
sure he must have other customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no proof of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we forget Al Gepper for the time being,
and concentrate on the Celestial Temple,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
proposed. &ldquo;In the meantime, learn everything you can
about the man&rsquo;s methods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No assignment would please me more, Dad. I&rsquo;ve
the same as promised Mr. Gepper he&rsquo;ll land in jail, and
I want to make good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker began to pace the floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write a
scorching editorial,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fight ignorance
with information. Our reporters must learn how these
mediums do their tricks, and expose them to the gullible
public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to help,&rdquo; Penny promised
eagerly. &ldquo;May I have Al Gepper for my particular fish
bait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s your assignment. And I&rsquo;m depending upon
you to see that he doesn&rsquo;t work any of his trickery on
Mrs. Weems. If she can&rsquo;t be persuaded to remain
away from the Hodges&rsquo;, then we must protect her as
best we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to accompany her every time she goes there,
Dad. I am afraid he may be after her money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gepper doesn&rsquo;t know she inherited six thousand
dollars?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she dropped the information that she had
come into money. He supplied figures himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea, Dad. Gepper is as clever
a man as ever I met. Honestly, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me
if he does produce Cousin David at tomorrow&rsquo;s
s&eacute;ance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker snorted in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommyrot! The man will make an excuse about
the conditions not being right, and fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but he seems pretty confident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You expect to attend the s&eacute;ance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, definitely. Jungle beasts couldn&rsquo;t keep me
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then be alert every instant&mdash;without appearing
too suspicious, of course. Try to learn how the man
accomplishes his tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;Mr. Al Gepper
is due for his first shock when he wakes up tomorrow
and reads that the Celestial Temple has been raided.
Unless I am much mistaken, that place is one of his
favorite haunts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the newspaper office, Penny went directly
home. She longed to stop at the Sidell home, but she
had promised her father to say nothing about the
planned raid until it was an accomplished fact. Feeling
the need of work to occupy her time, she washed the
maroon car and waxed the fading paint of Leaping
Lena.</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock her father came home for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; Penny asked, running to meet him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s set,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;DeWitt laid your
information before the police. Tonight three detectives
will attend the meeting at the Temple. If anything
out of the way happens, the raid will be staged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was so tense with expectation that she was
unable to do justice to the delicious dinner which Mrs.
Weems had prepared. Her father, too, seemed unusually
restless. After dinner he made a pretense of reading
the paper, but actually his eyes did not see the
print.</p>
<p>The hands of the clock scarcely appeared to move,
so slowly did time pass. Eight o&rsquo;clock came, then nine.
Suddenly the telephone rang.</p>
<p>Penny was away in an instant to answer it. From
the next room she called to her father:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you, Dad! DeWitt, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him to telephone me as soon as the raid was
staged.&rdquo; Mr. Parker arose and went quickly to take
the receiver. Penny hovered at his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! DeWitt?&rdquo; the publisher asked, and after a
slight pause: &ldquo;Oh, I see. No, I don&rsquo;t think Penny was
mistaken. It&rsquo;s more likely there was a tip-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver and turned toward Penny
who anticipated the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The raid was a failure?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Penny. Detectives spent two hours at the
meeting. Nothing happened. It was impossible to make
arrests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have been recognized as detectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others will be assigned to the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, Penny. DeWitt reports that the police
have become convinced that the spiritualists who use
the Temple are not operating for profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise and I know better because she was approached.&rdquo;
Penny anxiously regarded her father. &ldquo;Dad,
even if the police do give up, we won&rsquo;t, will we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re in this fight and we&rsquo;ll stay in it,&rdquo; he answered
grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put some new teeth in our trap.
And the next time it&rsquo;s sprung, I warrant you we&rsquo;ll
catch a crook.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">14</span>
<br /><i>WET PAINT</i></h2>
<p>Promptly at two o&rsquo;clock the following afternoon,
Penny and Mrs. Weems presented themselves at
the Hodges&rsquo; cottage for the appointed s&eacute;ance. Already
Mr. Gepper awaited them in the darkened apartment
on the second floor.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s glance about the room found everything in
the same order as upon the previous visit, save that an
easel with a large black sheet of artist&rsquo;s paper stood
beside the cabinet.</p>
<p>She moved as if to examine it. Al Gepper intercepted
her by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit here, if you please. Beside Mrs. Weems. I&rsquo;ll call
the Hodges and we&rsquo;ll start at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The medium went to the door and shouted down
the stairway. Penny noticed that he remained where
he could watch her every move in a mirror which
hung on the wall. She shrewdly guessed that he was
afraid she might attempt to examine either the cabinet
or the easel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hodges came in response to the call,
taking chairs about the circular table. The gaze which
they fastened upon Al Gepper was almost worshipful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now today I hope to materialize the Spirit of
Cousin David,&rdquo; announced the medium. &ldquo;The task
will be difficult, as you must realize. After the s&eacute;ance
begins I am compelled to request absolute quiet. The
slightest movement may frighten away the Spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are spirits so timid?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because their beings are so sensitive that they instantly
feel an unfriendly presence,&rdquo; the man responded
glibly. &ldquo;Please hold hands, and use every precaution
that contact is not broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems took one of Penny&rsquo;s hands and Mr.
Hodges the other. Mrs. Hodges sat next to her husband.</p>
<p>After lowering black curtains over the window
blinds to further darken the room, the medium returned
to his chair. Those at the table were unable to
distinguish his form, and for a time there was no sound
save the scratching music of a phonograph record.</p>
<p>Presently the medium exhorted the Spirit of Cousin
David to appear. For at least ten minutes there was no
indication that communication was to be established.
Then a cowbell tinkled, causing Mrs. Weems to shake
and tremble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there, David?&rdquo; called the medium.</p>
<p>The bell jingled violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ready, David,&rdquo; intoned the medium.
&ldquo;Have you a message for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Penny&rsquo;s amazement, a pair of shapely white
hands slowly materialized, apparently pulling aside
the curtain of the cabinet above the medium&rsquo;s head.
In the darkness they glowed with a weird phosphorescent
light.</p>
<p>Next appeared a white-rimmed slate, upon which
luminous words were written: &ldquo;I am the Spirit of
Cousin David. Is Maud here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Weems, quivering with
excitement. &ldquo;Have you a message for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the hand wrote: &ldquo;My happiness in this world
beyond is disturbed. Maud, do not squander the
money which I gave to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squander it?&rdquo; the housekeeper said aloud. &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;ve scarcely spent a penny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trip to California is ill-advised,&rdquo; wrote the hand.
&ldquo;Invest your money in good eight per cent securities.
There are many excellent companies&mdash;the Brantwell
Corporation, White and Edwards, the Bierkamp Company.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>The slate vanished and once more the jingling of
the cowbell denoted that the spirit was moving away.</p>
<p>The medium spoke. &ldquo;Contact has been broken.
Shall we try to reach Cousin David again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what to do now. I&rsquo;ve planned on the western trip and
I can&rsquo;t understand why Cousin David should advise
me to give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go agin&rsquo; the Spirits if I was you,&rdquo; advised
Mr. Hodges. &ldquo;You better change your plans,
Maud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I be certain that the message came
from Cousin David?&rdquo; the housekeeper quavered. &ldquo;Oh,
dear, I am so upset! If only I could be certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I hope you do not distrust me,&rdquo; said Al
Gepper reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it&rsquo;s not that. I&rsquo;m just upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, if you actually saw your cousin it would
set your mind at rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot promise, but we will try. Hold hands
again please, and everyone concentrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed an interval during which the medium
pleaded with the Spirit of Cousin David to return
and show himself. Suddenly the group was startled
to see a luminous banjo move high through the
air, unsupported by any hand. It began to play &ldquo;Down
upon the Swanee River.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Midway through the selection, the music broke off
and the banjo disappeared. An instant later Mrs.
Hodges uttered a choked cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The easel! Look at it, Maud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes turned toward the painter&rsquo;s canvas. As the
medium focused a flashlight upon it, the face of an
elderly man slowly materialized on the blank surface,
the picture appearing in red, blue and finally black oil
paint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> Cousin David!&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Weems, gripping
Penny&rsquo;s hand so tightly that it hurt. &ldquo;He looks
exactly as he did when last I saw him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The medium extinguished his light and again the
room was dark. Mrs. Weems&rsquo; chair creaked as she
stirred restlessly. Mr. Hodges&rsquo; heavy breathing could
be plainly heard. There was no other sound. Everyone
waited in tense expectancy, sensing that the climax of
the s&eacute;ance was at hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly, behind Al Gepper&rsquo;s chair a spot of
ethereal light appeared. As Penny watched, it grew in
size until the figure had assumed the proportions of a
man. Then, to her further amazement, it slowly rose
toward the ceiling, hovering above Mrs. Weems&rsquo; chair.</p>
<p>Throughout the s&eacute;ance Penny had remained firm in
her conviction that the medium had resorted to trickery
to produce his startling effects. Although she could
not be sure, she thought that several times he had
slipped from his chair to enter the conveniently placed
cabinet. She also believed that the only way he could
have materialized the ghost was by donning luminous
robes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll end his little game once and for all,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p>Deliberately she waited until the ghostly figure
floated close to her own chair. Then with a sudden upward
spring, she snatched at it.</p>
<p>Greatly to her chagrin, her hand encountered nothing
solid. With the speed of lightning, the figure
streaked toward the cabinet behind Al Gepper&rsquo;s chair
and was seen no more.</p>
<p>Arising, the medium switched on the room lights.
His face was white with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warned you to make no move,&rdquo; he said harshly
to Penny. &ldquo;You deliberately disobeyed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, why did you do it?&rdquo; wailed Mrs.
Weems. &ldquo;I was so eager to get another message from
Cousin David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Spirit has been frightened away,&rdquo; announced
the medium. &ldquo;It will be impossible ever to recall him.
For that matter, I shall never again conduct a s&eacute;ance
with this young person present. She is a disturbing
element.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, you&rsquo;ve ruined everything,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Weems accusingly. &ldquo;Why do you act so outrageously?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Penny started to speak and then changed her mind.
Mrs. Weems, the seamstress and her husband, all were
gazing at her with deep reproach. She realized that
there was nothing she could say which would make
them understand.</p>
<p>She arose and walked to the easel. The painting of
Cousin David remained clearly visible. She touched
it and then glanced at her finger which bore a streak
of red.</p>
<p>The paint was still wet.</p>
<p>Penny stared at her finger a moment. Lifting her
eyes she met the triumphant gaze of Al Gepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even a skillful artist could have painted a
picture so quickly,&rdquo; he said with a smirk. &ldquo;Only a
spirit would have the ability. You are dumbfounded,
my little one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just plain dumb,&rdquo; answered Penny. &ldquo;I salute
you, Mr. Gepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for Mrs. Weems, she turned and
went from the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now how <i>did</i> he do it?&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I saw
everything and yet I am more in the dark than ever.
But I am sure of one thing. Unless I work fast, Al
Gepper is almost certain to obtain Mrs. Weems&rsquo; inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>HIDDEN MONEY</i></h2>
<p>One of Penny&rsquo;s first acts upon arriving home was
to scan the telephone directory under the heading,
Investment Firms. The three companies mentioned
during the s&eacute;ance, White and Edwards, Brantwell, and
Bierkamp, were unlisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently there are no such firms in Riverview,&rdquo;
she reflected. &ldquo;But why was Mrs. Weems advised to
invest her money with one of them? It looks very
suspicious to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not until after five o&rsquo;clock did Mrs. Weems return
from the Hodges&rsquo;. She seemed rather upset, and when
Penny tried to bring up the subject of the s&eacute;ance, said
distantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Penny, I prefer not to discuss it. Your conduct
was disgraceful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I apologize for grabbing at the ghost, Mrs. Weems.
I only did it to prove that Al Gepper is a fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your motives were quite apparent. One could not
blame Mr. Gepper for being angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems,&rdquo; said Penny in desperation.
&ldquo;How can you be taken in by his smooth line? His
one purpose is to obtain your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very unjust,&rdquo; the housekeeper responded.
&ldquo;Today I tried to pay Mr. Gepper for the s&eacute;ance and
he would not accept one penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he is playing for higher stakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use discussing the matter with you,&rdquo; Mrs.
Weems shrugged. &ldquo;You are prejudiced and will give
the man credit for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give him credit for being very clever. Mrs.
Weems, please promise that you&rsquo;ll not allow him to
invest your money for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no intention of doing so, Penny. It does seem
to me that I should consider Cousin David&rsquo;s wishes in
the matter. Very likely I shall abandon my plans for
the western trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And stay here with us?&rdquo; Penny cried eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am thinking of going to a larger city and
taking an apartment. With my money invested in
eight per cent securities, I should have a comfortable
little income.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, I&rsquo;ve heard Dad say over and over
that sound securities will not pay such a high rate of
interest. Promise you won&rsquo;t invest your money until
you&rsquo;ve talked with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always asking me to promise something or
other,&rdquo; the housekeeper sighed. &ldquo;This time I shall use
my own judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing that further argument was only a waste of
breath, Penny wandered outside to await her father.
When he came, they sat together on the front porch
steps, discussing the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop a word of advice to Mrs. Weems at the
first opportunity,&rdquo; offered Mr. Parker. &ldquo;If she is in the
mood you describe, it would not be wise to bring up
the subject tonight. She merely would resent my interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What worries me is that I am afraid she may have
told Al Gepper where the money is kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll urge her again to deposit it in a
bank. We&rsquo;ll do our best to protect her from these
sharpers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publisher had been very much interested in
Penny&rsquo;s account of the s&eacute;ance. However, he was unable
to explain how the various tricks had been accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Penny said thoughtfully, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t suppose
there&rsquo;s any chance it wasn&rsquo;t trickery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! I hope you&rsquo;re not falling under this
fellow&rsquo;s spell?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it gave me a real shock when I saw Cousin
David&rsquo;s face materialize on the canvas. It was the absolute
image of him&mdash;or rather of a picture Mrs. Weems
once showed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A startled expression came over Penny&rsquo;s face. Without
explanation, she sprang to her feet and ran to the
kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;did you ever get it back?
Your picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What picture, Penny?&rdquo; The housekeeper scarcely
glanced up as she vigorously scrubbed carrots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the one of Cousin David. You allowed a
photographer to take it for enlargement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been returned,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems admitted.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine why the work takes so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; announced Penny. &ldquo;But you never
would believe me if I told you, so I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Racing to the porch, she revealed to her father what
she thought had occurred. It was her theory that the
agent who had called at the Parker home days earlier
had in actuality been one of Al Gepper&rsquo;s assistants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Dad!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The man obtained
a picture of Cousin David, and probably turned
it over to the medium.&rdquo; Her face fell slightly. &ldquo;Of
course, that still doesn&rsquo;t explain how the painting
slowly materialized.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor does it explain the ghost or the banjo. Penny,
couldn&rsquo;t Gepper have painted the picture himself in
the darkness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t time, Dad. Besides, he held a flashlight
on the painting. No human hand touched it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say, too, that the banjo was high overhead
when it played?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Dad. Gepper couldn&rsquo;t have reached
the strings. The instrument floated free in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds fantastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, it was, Dad. It&rsquo;s no wonder Gepper is
gaining such influence over Mrs. Weems. He&rsquo;s as slick
as a greased fox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Jerry go to the house and try to learn how
the fellow operates,&rdquo; declared Mr. Parker. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
break the story until we have absolute evidence that
Gepper has obtained money under false pretenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Penny remained close at home. Mrs.
Weems still treated her somewhat distantly, leaving
the house immediately after lunch and declining to explain
where she was going. Penny was quite certain
that her destination was the Hodges&rsquo; cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll run over and see Louise,&rdquo; she thought
restlessly. &ldquo;Nothing to do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could leave the house, the doorbell rang.
A man of perhaps thirty, well dressed, with a leather
briefcase tucked under his arm, stood on the front
porch. He bowed politely to Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is where Mrs. Weems resides, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she isn&rsquo;t here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will she be home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;Are you an agent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s appearance displeased her although she
could not have said exactly why. His smile was too
ingratiating, his eyes calculating and hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Bierkamp,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I represent
the Harold G. Bierkamp Investment Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stiffened. She glared at the agent. &ldquo;You mean
you represent the Al Gepper Spookus Company,&rdquo; she
said in a cutting voice. &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Weems doesn&rsquo;t
want any of your wonderful eight per cent stocks!
She&rsquo;ll not see you, so don&rsquo;t come here again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are you to speak for her?&rdquo; the man retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you come here again, I&rsquo;ll call the police,&rdquo; Penny
threatened. &ldquo;Now get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word, the man retreated down
the street. Penny watched until he turned a corner
and was lost to view. She was a trifle worried as to
what she had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mrs. Weems learns about this she&rsquo;ll never forgive
me,&rdquo; she thought uneasily. &ldquo;But he was a crook
sent by Al Gepper. I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Wandering upstairs, she entered the bathroom, intending
to wash before going to Louise&rsquo;s home. On
the tiled floor lay a velvet ribbon with a key attached.
At once, Penny realized that Mrs. Weems had left it
there inadvertently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the key to her desk,&rdquo; she reflected, picking it
up. &ldquo;And she insists that her money is kept in a safe
place! I have a notion to play a joke on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The longer Penny considered the idea, the more it
pleased her. Jubilantly, she set forth for the Sidell
home. Taking Louise into her confidence, she visited
a novelty shop and purchased a supply of fake money.</p>
<p>Returning home, she then unlocked the drawer of
Mrs. Weems&rsquo; desk and, removing the six thousand
dollars, replaced it with neat stacks of imitation bills.
Louise watched her with misgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, this joke of yours isn&rsquo;t likely to strike
Mrs. Weems as very funny,&rdquo; she warned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always
doing things which get you into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is in a good cause, Lou. I am protecting Mrs.
Weems from her own folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deposit it in a bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are taking matters into your hands with a
vengeance! Suppose you&rsquo;re robbed on the way downtown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would complicate my life. Upon second
thought, I&rsquo;ll send for an armored truck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>To Louise&rsquo;s amazement, Penny actually carried
through her plan. A heavily guarded express truck
presently drew up before the Parker residence, and
Mrs. Weems&rsquo; money was turned over to the two
armed men who promised that it would be delivered
safely to the First National Bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s a load off my mind,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;Just let Al Gepper try to steal Mrs. Weems&rsquo; money
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise shook her head sadly. &ldquo;You may be accused
of stealing yourself. I wouldn&rsquo;t be in your slippers
when Mrs. Weems learns about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be able to explain,&rdquo; laughed Penny.</p>
<p>The joke she had played did not seem quite so funny
an hour later. Mrs. Weems returned home and without
comment recovered the key which had been replaced
on the lavatory floor. She did not open her desk
or mention the money.</p>
<p>At dinner Penny was so subdued that the housekeeper
inquired if she were ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; the girl answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just thinking
about the future. It&rsquo;s so depressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a picture show would cheer us all,&rdquo; proposed
Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems displayed interest, and Penny, without
enthusiasm, agreed to go. Eight o&rsquo;clock found them
at the Avalon, a neighborhood theatre. The show was
not to Penny&rsquo;s liking, although her father and the
housekeeper seemed to enjoy it. She squirmed restlessly,
and finally whispered to her father that she was
returning home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>In truth, as Penny well knew, she was suffering
from an acute case of &ldquo;conscience.&rdquo; Now that it was
too late, she regretted having meddled with Mrs.
Weems&rsquo; money.</p>
<p>Gloomily she walked home alone. As she entered,
she heard the telephone ringing, but before she could
answer, the party hung up. With a sigh Penny locked
the front door again, switched out the lights and went
to bed.</p>
<p>For a long while she lay staring at a patch of moonlight
on the bedroom carpet. Although she felt tired
she could not sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as Louise said,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always
getting myself into hot water and for no good reason,
either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her morose thoughts were interrupted as a hard
object thudded against a nearby wall. Penny sat up,
listening. She believed that the sound had come from
Mrs. Weems&rsquo; room, yet she knew she was alone in the
house.</p>
<p>Rolling from bed, she groped for a robe, and without
turning on the lights, tiptoed down the hall. Mrs.
Weems&rsquo; door stood open. Was some intruder hidden
in that room?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Peering inside, Penny at first noticed nothing amiss.
Then her gaze fastened on the window sill, plainly
visible in the moonlight. Two iron hooks, evenly
spaced, had been clamped over the ledge!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">16</span>
<br /><i>OVER THE WINDOW LEDGE</i></h2>
<p>As Penny flattened herself against the wall, the
head and shoulders of a man slowly rose into view.
Although his body was plainly silhouetted in the
moonlight, she could not see his face.</p>
<p>The intruder raised the sash, making no sound. He
hesitated, listening a moment, then dropped lightly
into the bedroom.</p>
<p>Without turning on a flashlight which he carried, he
went directly to Mrs. Weems&rsquo; desk. So deliberate was
the action that Penny instantly decided the fellow had
come for a particular purpose and knew the lay-out of
the entire house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means to steal Mrs. Weems&rsquo; money!&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p>Opening the desk, the man tried the drawer where
the inheritance funds had been hidden. Failing to unlock
it with a key, he took a tool from his pocket and
in a moment had broken the lock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Removing the stack of fake bills which Penny had
substituted, he thrust them into his coat. Taking no
interest in anything else in the room, he moved
stealthily toward the window.</p>
<p>Penny knew there was no one within calling distance
and that the man probably was armed. Wisdom
dictated that she remain in hiding, but she was determined
the thief should not escape. Hoping to take him
by surprise, she stalked forward.</p>
<p>A board creaked. With a muttered exclamation the
man whirled around. At the same instant Penny flung
herself upon him, diving low in imitation of a football
tackle.</p>
<p>The thief reeled, but instead of falling he recovered
his balance and gave Penny a tremendous shove which
sent her sprawling backwards. Before she could regain
her feet, he ran to the window. Swinging himself over
the ledge, he vanished from view.</p>
<p>By the time Penny reached the window there was
no sign of the intruder. He had disappeared as if into
thin air. However, she knew that the man must have
descended by means of a ladder which he had hastily
removed.</p>
<p>She ran her hand over the window ledge. The iron
hooks no longer were there, only the scars which had
been cut in the wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This undoubtedly was the same fellow who broke
into the Kohl apartment!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;But how did
he escape so quickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny started for a telephone, intending to notify
the police. However, when it occurred to her that her
father might not wish the matter made public, she
changed her mind and ran downstairs.</p>
<p>Unlocking the rear door, she glanced carefully
about the yard. There was no one in sight, no movement
behind any of the shrubbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone, of course,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Penny wore no shoes. Finding a pair of old galoshes
on the porch, she protected her feet with them, and
hobbled into the yard.</p>
<p>The grass beneath Mrs. Weems&rsquo; window had been
trampled, but at first glance there was no clue to indicate
how the burglar had gained entrance to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously he used a ladder,&rdquo; she reasoned. &ldquo;But
how did he descend so quickly? And what became of
the ladder? I know he never had time to carry away
one of the ordinary type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dark object lying on the grass attracted Penny&rsquo;s
attention. Picking it up, she carried it to the porch and
switched on a light that she might see to better advantage.
In her hand she held a torn strand of black
silk rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This may be an important clue!&rdquo; she thought excitedly.
&ldquo;I know now how the man entered the
house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny examined the piece of rope, automobile
headlight beams cut a path across the yard. The Parker
car drew up on the driveway and both Mrs. Weems
and Mr. Parker alighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, come here quickly!&rdquo; Penny called as he
started to open the garage doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the publisher and Mrs. Weems came toward
the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a burglar,&rdquo; Penny announced. &ldquo;He
broke into Mrs. Weems&rsquo; room, smashing the lock on
the desk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My money!&rdquo; the housekeeper exclaimed in horror.
&ldquo;Oh, Penny, don&rsquo;t tell me that it&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He escaped with the contents of the drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems gave a moan of anguish. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you
called the police?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;When did it happen?
Tell me everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, I&rsquo;ll set your mind at rest,&rdquo; Penny replied.
&ldquo;Your money is safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I never was so relieved in all my born days.&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems sagged weakly into a porch rocker.
&ldquo;Penny, how could you torture me by letting me
think the money was stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have a confession to make, Mrs. Weems.
You left the key to your desk lying on the bathroom
floor. I thought it might be a good joke to move the
money to another place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you darling blessed girl!&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Weems. &ldquo;Where did you hide it, Penny? Are you sure
it&rsquo;s safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be. I had it taken to the First National
Bank and deposited in your name. The thief carried
off a package of fake money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather high-handed weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; commented her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you scold her,&rdquo; spoke Mrs. Weems
quickly. &ldquo;I am glad Penny acted as she did. Otherwise,
I might have lost my entire inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny drew a deep breath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m relieved you feel
that way about it. I wish I could see the burglar&rsquo;s face
when he discovers he stole worthless money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the housekeeper and Mr. Parker pressed her
with questions. She revealed exactly what had occurred
during their absence, showing them the strand
of black silk rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I think this may be a valuable clue,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;What does it suggest to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of anything, I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that when the Kohls were robbed
the police couldn&rsquo;t figure out how the burglar gained
entrance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I recall the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe the same man committed both
burglaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Kohl&rsquo;s the police found two marks on the
window ledge apparently made by iron hooks. Similar
marks are on the sill in Mrs. Weems&rsquo; room. For that
matter, I distinctly saw the iron pieces bite into the
wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look at them,&rdquo; proposed Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the marks are there now, Dad. The man
jerked the hooks loose after he descended. They must
have been attached to his ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said he had none, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no time for him to have carried away
an ordinary, heavy ladder. I think the one he used
must have been made of silk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is a piece of it!&rdquo; Mr. Parker exclaimed,
examining the twisted strand with new interest. &ldquo;Your
theory sounds plausible. It would be possible for a
man to scale a wall with such a ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could jerk loose the hooks in an instant, too,
Dad. The ladder would fit into a small suitcase, or
even his pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one objection to your theory, Penny. How
could such a ladder be raised to the window ledge? It
naturally would be limp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That part has me puzzled, I&rsquo;ll admit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never even heard of a silken ladder,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Weems doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once saw one being made,&rdquo; declared Penny with
deliberate emphasis. &ldquo;At a Japanese Shop on Dorr
Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you spoke of it!&rdquo; exclaimed her
father. &ldquo;Penny, you may have something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Dad. This strand of twisted silk may
lead straight to Kano&rsquo;s Curio Shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, glancing at Mrs. Weems. She knew
that the housekeeper might take offense, but she answered
quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My guess would be to Al Gepper, Dad. Who but
he or an accomplice could have known where the
money was hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">17</span>
<br /><i>KANO&rsquo;S CURIO SHOP</i></h2>
<p>As Penny had anticipated, Mrs. Weems indignantly
declared that she did not believe Mr. Gepper could
have had any connection with the attempted robbery.
Yet, even as she made the assertion, a startled expression
came over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think back, Mrs. Weems,&rdquo; urged Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;How many persons knew where you had secreted the
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Mrs. Hodges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Al Gepper?&rdquo; Penny probed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; The housekeeper looked ill at ease. &ldquo;He
may have heard me talking with Mrs. Hodges. I remember
he passed through the hall while we were
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What day was that?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday. After the s&eacute;ance. But I can&rsquo;t believe
that Mr. Gepper would try to steal the money. I just
can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;From what Penny has told me of the man, I should
judge that he is a schemer,&rdquo; contributed Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;You know the <i>Star</i> has started a vigorous campaign
directed against such mediums as Al Gepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he told me such remarkable things about
Cousin David,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;Facts which
couldn&rsquo;t be faked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gepper doesn&rsquo;t make many false moves,&rdquo; acknowledged
Penny. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a smooth worker. All the
same, he&rsquo;s a fake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he have faked Cousin David&rsquo;s message?
You forget we actually saw the picture of my relative
painted without the aid of a human hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the picture closely resemble your cousin?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed. It looked exactly as I saw him
many years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather odd?&rdquo; demanded Penny. &ldquo;One
would expect Cousin David to age a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny believes that a photographer&rsquo;s agent who
came here a few days ago was sent by Gepper to obtain
a picture of your relative,&rdquo; explained Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;Did the man ask you many questions about your
cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, he did,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems admitted unwillingly.
&ldquo;I made a mistake giving him the photograph.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems fairly evident that the picture was used
by Gepper,&rdquo; Mr. Parker commented. &ldquo;Whether he
plotted to steal your money remains to be proven.
Penny, you saw the man plainly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, Dad. Not his face. He was about the
same build as Gepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not much to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the first Gepper was determined to get Mrs.
Weems&rsquo; money, Dad. He sent a man here who pretended
to be from the Bierkamp Investment Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no I didn&rsquo;t. I was afraid you would invest
your money with him, so I drove the man away. He
must have been Gepper&rsquo;s accomplice. Failing to acquire
the money by that means, he plotted the burglary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t agree with Penny?&rdquo; the housekeeper
asked Mr. Parker unhappily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In general, I am afraid I do. Mr. Gepper is an undesirable
character, and I should like nothing better
than to send him to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come upstairs, Mrs. Weems,&rdquo; urged Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you the desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the housekeeper and Mr. Parker followed her
to the second floor. An examination of the bedroom
disclosed no additional clues, but after studying the
marks on the window ledge, the publisher favored
Penny&rsquo;s theory that a silk ladder had been utilized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was unwise of me to keep my money here,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems remarked in a crestfallen tone. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
been silly about everything, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gave her a quick hug. &ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t.
Anyone might have been taken in by Al Gepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never attend another of his s&eacute;ances. I&rsquo;ll urge
Mrs. Hodges to turn him from her house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, are you willing to help get evidence
against him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Parker abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go to the Hodges&rsquo; exactly as you have in the
past,&rdquo; instructed the publisher. &ldquo;Penny has been
warned by Gepper not to attend any of the s&eacute;ances,
but you&rsquo;ll still be welcome. Learn everything you can
and report to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to do it, Mr. Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t allow him to guess that you have become
suspicious. Above all, never withdraw your money
from the bank at his suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure I won&rsquo;t. This has taught me a
bitter lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you an assignment for me, Dad?&rdquo; inquired
Penny. &ldquo;How about Kano&rsquo;s Curio Shop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early tomorrow I&rsquo;ll send Jerry there to question
the old Jap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you notify the police?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the present. If we can crack this story I&rsquo;d
like to get it ahead of the <i>Record</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would send me to Kano&rsquo;s instead of
Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorr Street is no place for you, Penny,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker replied, dismissing the matter. &ldquo;Shall we get to
bed now? It&rsquo;s nearly midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the doors had been locked once more Penny
went to her room, but she did not immediately fall
asleep. Instead, she kept mulling over the events of the
night. The more she thought about it the more firmly
she became convinced that both the Kohl home and
her own had been entered by the same person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The telephone was ringing when I came from the
movie,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;Now I wonder who called? It
may have been a trick of the thief to learn if anyone
were in the house. When no one answered, the assumption
would be that the coast was clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny felt rather well satisfied with the way matters
had developed. In one bold stroke she had saved Mrs.
Weems&rsquo; inheritance, convinced the housekeeper that
Al Gepper was not to be trusted, and had made definite
progress in gaining evidence to be used in her
father&rsquo;s campaign against the charlatan invaders of
Riverview. Yet it annoyed her that the story, now
that it had reached an active stage, was to be turned
over to Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a notion to visit the Kano Curio Shop ahead
of him,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having made up her mind, she rolled over and
promptly fell asleep.</p>
<p>In the morning Penny ate breakfast and wiped the
dishes with a speed which astonished Mrs. Weems.
Shortly after her father left for the office, she backed
her own maroon car from the garage, and offering
only a vague explanation, departed for Kano&rsquo;s Curio
Shop.</p>
<p>Dorr Street was quite deserted at such an early
hour, and the Japanese shop owner had just unlocked
his doors. He was sweeping the floor as Penny boldly
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Kano,&rdquo; she greeted him. &ldquo;You
remember me, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kano bowed, regarding her warily. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;You are the young lady whose curiosity is
very large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny smiled. &ldquo;You are right, Mr. Kano. It is very
large, especially about a certain silken ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kano frowned as he leaned on his broom. &ldquo;I
am very sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am a merchant, not one
who answers what you call the quiz-bee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny understood that the Japanese never would
tell her what she wished to know save under compulsion.
She decided to adopt firm tactics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kano,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my father is the owner of
the <i>Riverview Star</i> and he intends to expose certain
crooks who have been robbing wealthy persons such
as the Kohls. You read in the paper that their home
was entered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I read,&rdquo; the Japanese shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own theory is that the thief gained entrance
by means of a silk ladder,&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;<i>A ladder
made in this shop!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shopkeeper&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;Nothing. You go now, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go,&rdquo; said Penny, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll return with the police.
You would not like that, I take it?&rdquo; Her voice was
crisp and full of menace.</p>
<p>Mr. Kano lost some of his poise. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he answered
sharply. &ldquo;I am an honest man and want no sad trouble
with the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chancing to glance toward the street, Penny observed
Jerry Livingston standing on the opposite
corner. He was gazing thoughtfully toward the Curio
Shop, and she knew that he must have been sent by
her father to interview Mr. Kano. Inspired, she turned
again to the old Japanese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see that young man yonder?&rdquo; she asked, indicating
Jerry. &ldquo;I have but to summon him and he&rsquo;ll
come here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Detective?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Kano, peering anxiously
through the window. &ldquo;Do not call him! I am
an honest man. I will answer your questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me about the silken ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know little,&rdquo; the shopkeeper insisted. &ldquo;I made the
rope for a man who said: &lsquo;Do this or we will burn
your shop down, Mr. Kano.&rsquo; So I made the ladder and
he paid me well for fashioning it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name I do not know. But his eyes were small
and evil. His skin was dark, his nose crooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kano ceased speaking with an abruptness which
caused Penny to glance toward the door. Her first
thought was that Jerry had entered. Instead a strange
young man stood there, regarding her suspiciously.</p>
<p>As she stared at him he quickly retreated, but not
before she had caught a fleeting impression of a face
which matched Mr. Kano&rsquo;s description with startling
accuracy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he the one?&rdquo; she demanded as the door
slammed. &ldquo;The man for whom you made the ladder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; denied the Japanese.</p>
<p>His words failed to convince Penny. Darting to the
door, she saw that the young man already was far
down the street, walking rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the one,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; called the Japanese as she started away, &ldquo;I
have more to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>It was a ruse to detain her, Penny knew. Pushing
past the shopkeeper who sought to bar the exit, she
reached the street and ran toward Jerry Livingston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Penny!&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprise. &ldquo;What
are you doing in this part of town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; she answered hastily. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
after a story, come along with me. We&rsquo;re trailing the
man who just left Kano&rsquo;s Shop.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>THE BELL TOWER</i></h2>
<p>Jerry fell into step with Penny. As they walked
along, she told him of her conversation with Mr. Kano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe this man we&rsquo;re following is the same one
who entered our house last night,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the same build as the fellow I grabbed. Besides, he fits
Kano&rsquo;s description of the person who bought the
silken ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; replied Jerry. &ldquo;If I
muff this assignment, I may wake up looking for another
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearing that the man ahead would discover he was
being followed, Jerry and Penny dropped farther and
farther behind. Presently they saw him enter a pawnshop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that place,&rdquo; commented Jerry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s run by
Spike Weiser, a notorious <i>fence</i>. He buys stolen goods
and gets rid of it at a profit. Has a swell home on
Clarmont Drive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t the police arrest him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they watch the place, but Spike is too smart
to be caught. He has a system for handling <i>hot</i> goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture some of the Kohl loot was sold through
him, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me. But if the police search
the place they won&rsquo;t find a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loitering on the opposite side of the street, Penny
and the reporter kept close watch of the pawnbroker&rsquo;s
shop. Thirty minutes elapsed. The man whom they
had trailed, did not reappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have slipped out the back door,&rdquo; Jerry
remarked. &ldquo;Probably knew he was being watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think so myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry glanced at his watch. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take any more
time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get back to the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch a few minutes longer,&rdquo; answered Penny.
&ldquo;If anything develops I&rsquo;ll try to telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry walked hurriedly away. Scarcely had he disappeared
when the door of the pawnshop opened, and
the young man who had entered a half hour earlier,
appeared. Penny hastily moved back into the vestibule
of an office building.</p>
<p>Without observing her, the stranger crossed the
street and walked briskly toward an intersecting boulevard.
There was no opportunity for Penny to telephone
the <i>Star</i> office. Following, she was hard pressed
to keep the man within view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Not until they reached the entrance of Butternut
Lane did it dawn upon her that the Celestial Temple
might be their destination. Then, indeed, her pulse
stepped up a pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly as I guessed!&rdquo; she thought triumphantly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s connected with Al Gepper and the
other mediums!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not wishing to attract attention in the deserted lane,
Penny took a short cut through the cemetery, emerging
at the rear of the Celestial Temple. There was no
door on that side of the building but a window had
been left raised. Placed beneath it, as if for her particular
convenience, was a large rock.</p>
<p>Penny stood on it, peering into the Temple. The
room was unoccupied. However, as she waited, the
same man she had trailed, quietly let himself in through
the front entrance, using a key. He glanced about and
called in a low voice: &ldquo;Pete! Pete! Anyone here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer, which seemed to please the
young man. He moved quickly down the aisle, crossed
the platform to a door which opened into the bell
tower. Kneeling he began to fit keys into the lock,
seeking one which would serve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>As Penny watched, the young man suddenly
straightened. Apparently he had heard footsteps in the
vestibule for he moved away from the bell tower door.</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman with dyed hair and a skin of
unusual pallor entered the Temple. She stopped short
as she saw the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here, Slippery?&rdquo; she commented, gazing at
him with distrust. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Pete?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sade. I was wonderin&rsquo; about Pete myself.
Just got here a minute ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s gaze fastened upon the key which had
been left in the bell tower door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s coming off here?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;You
were trying to get inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t ruffle your feathers, Sade,&rdquo; the man
said soothingly. &ldquo;I was only testing the door to make
sure it was locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet! You were aiming to break in! Slippery,
they sure named you right. Why, you&rsquo;d double-cross
your own mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quiet down,&rdquo; the man retorted angrily. &ldquo;I only
came here to make sure Pete was on the job. The lazy
loafer has skipped out and left the place unguarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman deliberately seated herself in a chair
beside the bell tower door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m parking here until Pete shows up,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re on the square, Slippery, but
I don&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for your flattering opinion,&rdquo; the man responded
mockingly. &ldquo;You give me a pain, Sade. I do
all the dangerous work, and what do I get? A measly
ten per cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plus what you stick in your pocket when you&rsquo;re
on a job,&rdquo; the woman shot back with rising anger.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been doing pretty well for yourself, Slippery&mdash;you
and Al. But the boys are getting wise. From
now on it may not be so easy. Better play fair with the
rest of us&mdash;or else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always did have a wagging tongue,&rdquo; the man
retorted. &ldquo;Always trying to stir up trouble. Don&rsquo;t you
realize we&rsquo;ve got to work together or we&rsquo;ll be jailed
separately? Our ranks must be united.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gettin&rsquo; sort of jittery, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you haven&rsquo;t been reading those editorials
in the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I read them and get a big laugh. This guy
Parker has to blow off steam. Nothing will come
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police have visited this place once already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did they find? Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no guarantee they won&rsquo;t try again. I tell you
this town is getting too hot for comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figurin&rsquo; on blowing?&rdquo; the woman inquired, watching
him shrewdly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Slippery&rsquo;s laughter had an unpleasant edge. &ldquo;You
sure do get ideas, Sade. Don&rsquo;t start peddling that line
of talk. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly losing his temper, the man strode nearer,
seizing her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just start something and see where you wake up!&rdquo;
he said harshly. &ldquo;One word to Pete or any of the boys
and you won&rsquo;t do any more pretty fortune telling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman jerked her arm free, gazing at the man
in sullen silence. Nor did she speak as he left the
Temple, slamming the door behind him.</p>

<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>PENNY INVESTIGATES</i></h2>
<p>Penny debated whether or not to follow Slippery.
Deciding that she should try to keep him within
sight, she abandoned her post beneath the window and
ran to the front of the building.</p>
<p>Already the young man was far down the lane,
walking rapidly. Before Penny could overtake him he
hailed a taxi and drove away. By the time she obtained
another cab, pursuit was futile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the <i>Star</i> office,&rdquo; Penny ordered the driver.</p>
<p>Although Slippery had eluded her, she did not feel
that her morning&rsquo;s work had been wasted. She believed
that her father would be very much interested in
a report of her findings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s evident that Slippery is connected with Al
Gepper and various mediums of the Celestial Temple,&rdquo;
she reflected. &ldquo;I am sure, too, that he&rsquo;s the one who
broke into our house, but to prove it may not be so
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Penny had not fully understood the conversation
which she had overheard between Slippery and Sade.
That they distrusted each other was evident, but why
had the woman feared Slippery might break into the
bell tower during the guard&rsquo;s absence?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of great value to the organization must
be kept there,&rdquo; she reasoned. &ldquo;But what can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny believed that her father would not delay in
requesting police to search the bell tower of the
Celestial Temple. However, a disappointment awaited
her.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the newspaper office DeWitt
stopped her as she went past his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go in there,&rdquo; he said, jerking his thumb toward
Mr. Parker&rsquo;s private room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Penny in surprise. &ldquo;Is Dad having
a conference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt nodded as he composed a two column headline.
&ldquo;With J. P. Henley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> Sugar Daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our biggest advertiser. He&rsquo;s threatening to go over
to the <i>Record</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s serious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is if he quits the <i>Star</i>. The old man&mdash;Mr. Parker&mdash;&rdquo; DeWitt
corrected hastily, &ldquo;has been trying to
soften him up for the past two hours. Whatever you
do, don&rsquo;t bust in there now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, Mr. DeWitt, but I did wish to see Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated. &ldquo;Well, I wanted to talk to him
about something I learned today at the Celestial
Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; nodded the city editor, his attention on
a sheet of copy. &ldquo;Mr. Parker is handling the campaign
personally. Sorry I can&rsquo;t be of service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather startled by DeWitt&rsquo;s unusual politeness,
Penny glanced hopefully toward Jerry Livingston&rsquo;s
desk. It was littered with papers, but quite deserted.</p>
<p>With a sigh she left the building and walked to Dorr
Street where she had left her maroon car. Upon reaching
home she found that Mrs. Weems was not there
and she had forgotten her own key. For a time she sat
disconsolately on the front porch. Then she decided
to go to the Hudell Garage where Leaping Lena had
been left for repairs three days earlier.</p>
<p>The car was ready, and with it a bill for eight dollars
and forty-two cents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to give you a dollar on account and pay
the remainder next week,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;Or would
you rather keep the car as a deposit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the dollar,&rdquo; said the garage man hastily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Penny became even more depressed as she drove
the automobile home. Not for the world would she
openly admit that she had made a mistake in repurchasing
Lena. Secretly she acknowledged that two
cars were an unbearable financial drain upon slender
resources.</p>
<p>Turning into her own street, Penny saw Mrs.
Weems walking toward home, and stopped for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from the Hodges&rsquo;,&rdquo; the housekeeper
commented, climbing into the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have?&rdquo; inquired Penny eagerly. &ldquo;Did you
learn anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. Mr. Gepper seemed very unwilling
to conduct another s&eacute;ance. He acted so different this
time&mdash;almost as if he bore me a personal grudge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably provoked because your inheritance
eluded him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did tell Mrs. Hodges that he doubted I had
any money,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened at the s&eacute;ance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing. The table moved and we heard a
few raps. That was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No message from Cousin David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word or a sign. Mr. Gepper seemed very
indifferent about it all. He said he couldn&rsquo;t give me
another appointment unless I paid for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about him now?&rdquo; Penny asked
curiously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you agree with Dad and me that
he was after your money?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was very silly,&rdquo; the housekeeper acknowledged.
&ldquo;Mrs. Hodges has begun to lose faith in him,
too. She says he&rsquo;s been bringing all sorts of folks to
her place. When she told him she didn&rsquo;t care to have
the house over-run with strangers, he became very
unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he threatened her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a mild way. He told her that he would stay as
long as he pleased and she could do nothing about it.
Mrs. Hodges is afraid to go to the police for fear
she&rsquo;ll be arrested with Mr. Gepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he ever has charged for his s&eacute;ances?&rdquo;
Penny said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he has, Penny. Of course I have no
proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, you must go there again this afternoon,&rdquo;
Penny urged. &ldquo;Insist upon another s&eacute;ance, and
pay him for it! Then you&rsquo;ll be able to testify as a
witness against him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t wish to go into court,&rdquo; the housekeeper
protested. &ldquo;Besides, Mr. Gepper won&rsquo;t be at
the cottage this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he going?&rdquo; Penny questioned alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I heard him tell Mrs. Hodges he
would be gone this afternoon, but would return for
an eight o&rsquo;clock s&eacute;ance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s fine&mdash;wonderful!&rdquo; chuckled Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Mrs. Weems gazed at the girl with sudden suspicion.
&ldquo;Now what have you thought up?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing alarming,&rdquo; grinned Penny. &ldquo;I merely plan
to visit Mr. Gepper&rsquo;s studio during his absence. Who
knows, I may yet master a few of the finer points
of ghost-making!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">20</span>
<br /><i>INSIDE THE CABINET</i></h2>
<p>Despite Mrs. Weems&rsquo; protests, Penny remained
firm in her decision to investigate Mr. Gepper&rsquo;s
studio. She ate a belatedly prepared lunch and did
not reach the Hodges&rsquo; cottage until nearly four
o&rsquo;clock, having driven there in Lena.</p>
<p>The doors were closed and Penny knocked several
times without receiving a response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone must have gone away,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Oh, dear, now what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny reasoned that it was of vital importance for
her to inspect Al Gepper&rsquo;s room during his absence.
She might never have another opportunity. Yet she
hesitated to enter the house while the Hodges were
away, even though she felt certain the seamstress
would not mind.</p>
<p>Walking to the rear, Penny noticed that the porch
screen had been left unfastened. Entering the kitchen,
she called Mrs. Hodges&rsquo; name but received no answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I wait for her to come home it may be too late,&rdquo;
decided Penny. &ldquo;This is an emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mind made up, she took the stairs two at a time
to Al Gepper&rsquo;s room. Her knock went unanswered.
Satisfied that he was not there, she tried the door and
found it unlocked.</p>
<p>Penny raised a blind to flood light into the darkened
room. Save that a film of dust covered the furniture,
everything was approximately the same as she had
last seen it.</p>
<p>Her gaze fell upon two suitcases which had been
pushed beneath the bed. The first contained only
miscellaneous clothing. The second merited a more
careful inspection.</p>
<p>Almost at once Penny came upon an old faded
picture, the one of Cousin David which Mrs. Weems
had given to the photographer&rsquo;s &ldquo;agent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was how it was done!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Al
Gepper sent one of his confederates to see Mrs. Weems
and obtain information about her cousin. The painting
which appeared so miraculously during the s&eacute;ance was
merely a copy of this! Even so, how was it painted
so quickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetting the picture for a moment, Penny picked
up several newspaper clippings which were fastened
together with a rubber band. All had been taken from
the obituary column and concerned the death of well-to-do
Riverview persons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Al Gepper and his pals are ghouls!&rdquo; Penny told
herself. &ldquo;They prey upon the relatives of persons who
have died, realizing that at such a time it will be much
easier to interest them in trying to communicate with
the departed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lifting a tray from the suitcase, her attention focused
upon a small red booklet. As she turned rapidly
through it, a folded sheet of paper fell to the floor.</p>
<p>Examining it, Penny saw a long list of names, together
with pertinent information about each person.
Not only was the address and financial standing of
the individual given, but the deceased relatives in each
family and other facts of a personal nature. The list
had been mimeographed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be a &lsquo;sucker&rsquo; list!&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;No
wonder it&rsquo;s easy for a medium to find victims and tell
them astonishing facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrusting the paper into her pocket, she turned her
attention to the wardrobe closet. Al Gepper&rsquo;s clothes
hung in orderly rows from the hangers. Behind them,
half hidden from view, was a small box.</p>
<p>Pulling it to the window, Penny examined the contents.
There were many bottles filled with chemicals,
the names of which were unfamiliar. She noted a bottle
of varnish, another of zinc white, and some photographic
paper in a sealed envelope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>A glance satisfying her, she replaced the box and
next turned her attention to the cabinet behind the
large circular table. Here she was richly rewarded
as her gaze fell upon a banjo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same one which played during Mrs. Weems&rsquo;
s&eacute;ance!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;We were able to see it in the
dark because it&rsquo;s covered with luminous paint. But
what made it rise into the air, and how could it play
without the aid of human hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny examined the instrument closely. She
chuckled as she discovered a tiny phonograph with
a record built into its back side. As she pressed a
control lever, it began a stringed version of &ldquo;Down
Upon the Swanee River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly turning it off, she inspected other objects
in the cabinet. At once she found a rod which could
be extended to a height of five feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how the banjo was raised!&rdquo; she reasoned.
&ldquo;And by use of this rod it would be easy to make a
ghost appear to float high overhead. This luminous
material must have been used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny picked up a filmy robe, shaking out the
many folds. While it was clear to her that Al Gepper
had employed the garment to materialize the so-called
spirit of Cousin David, she could only guess how he
had made it enlarge from a mere spot to a full sized
figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He must have wadded the cloth in his hand, and
held it above his head,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;Then he could
have slowly shaken it out until it covered his entire
body. Thus the figure would appear to grow in size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one corner of the cabinet Penny came upon a
luminous slate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was used for Cousin David&rsquo;s message,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;Al probably had an assistant who wrote on
it and thrust it through the curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While many questions remained unanswered, Penny
had obtained sufficient evidence to indicate that Al
Gepper was only a clever trickster. Greatly elated,
she decided to hasten to the <i>Star</i> office to report her
findings.</p>
<p>Noticing that she had neglected to return the two
suitcases to their former places, Penny pushed them
under the bed again. As she straightened, a door
slammed on the lower floor.</p>
<p>For an instant she hoped that it was Mrs. Hodges
or her husband who had come home. Then she heard
footsteps on the stairs, and their rapidity warned her
that they could belong only to a young person.</p>
<p>Frantically, she gazed about the room. The cabinet
seemed to offer the safest hiding place. Slipping into
it, she pulled the black curtain across the opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>STARTLING INFORMATION</i></h2>
<p>Scarcely had Penny hidden herself when Al
Gepper entered the room. With him was the hook-nosed
young man known as Slippery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Al,&rdquo; the latter was saying, &ldquo;this town
is getting too hot for comfort. We&rsquo;ve got to blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that Parker girl who queered everything,&rdquo;
muttered Gepper. &ldquo;How could I know that her father
was a newspaper publisher? He&rsquo;s stirred up folks with
his editorials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never should have let her in here. We had a
swell set-up, but now we can expect a raid any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I thought she was just a smart-aleck kid,
a friend of the Hodges&rsquo;. Didn&rsquo;t learn until yesterday
who she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to blow, Al. Sade&rsquo;s threatening to make
trouble, too. She thinks we&rsquo;re holding out on the
others.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have picked up a little extra coin now and
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Al, but we&rsquo;ve always been the brains of the
outfit. We take most of the risk, plan all the big jobs,
so why shouldn&rsquo;t we have more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we cut loose from &rsquo;em, Slippery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking! But we can&rsquo;t pull out until
the Henley job comes off. I&rsquo;ve had a tip that the house
is likely to be deserted tonight. Let&rsquo;s make the haul
and then skip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; agreed Gepper. &ldquo;I have some suckers
coming for a s&eacute;ance at eight. I&rsquo;ll get rid of them in
quick time, and be waiting. So long, Slippery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A door slammed, telling Penny that the hook-nosed
man had left. She was somewhat stunned by
what she had overheard, believing that the Henley
who had been mentioned must be her father&rsquo;s chief
advertiser.</p>
<p>Nervously she waited inside the cabinet, wishing
that she might take her information to the police. To
her intense annoyance, Al Gepper did not leave the
room even for a moment.</p>
<p>Instead he threw himself on the bed and read a
tabloid newspaper. After an hour, he arose and began
to prepare his supper on an electric grill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Penny shifted from one position to another, growing
more impatient. Every time the man came toward the
cabinet her heart beat a trifle faster. She was quite
sure the Hodges had not yet returned home, and
should Al Gepper discover her, he would not treat
her kindly.</p>
<p>The medium finished his supper and stacked the
dishes in the closet without washing them. Then he
started to get ready for the night&rsquo;s s&eacute;ance.</p>
<p>Peeping from between the cracks of the curtain,
Penny saw him seat himself before the easel. With
painstaking care he painted a picture of a woman,
using a photograph as a model. After a coating of
varnish had been applied, he allowed it to dry and
afterwards covered the entire picture with zinc white.
The original painting was entirely hidden.</p>
<p>Penny knew that hours had elapsed. The room
gradually darkened, and Al Gepper turned on the
lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I must get out of here soon!&rdquo; the girl
thought desperately. &ldquo;But if I make a break for it
he&rsquo;ll be sure to see me. That will ruin all my plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight o&rsquo;clock came. Al Gepper put on his coat,
combed his hair and was alertly waiting when the
doorbell rang. However, instead of descending the
stairs he shouted an invitation for the visitors to come
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Two women in their early forties were ushered
into the s&eacute;ance chamber, to be followed almost immediately
by an elderly man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will start at once if you please,&rdquo; said Al Gepper
brusquely. &ldquo;I have another engagement tonight. However,
before the s&eacute;ance is undertaken I must ask that
each of you pay the required fee, five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The money was paid, and the three persons seated
themselves at the table. Gepper switched off the lights.</p>
<p>The s&eacute;ance began in much the same manner as the
one Penny had attended. The medium called upon
the spirit of a woman named Flora to appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now concentrate hard&mdash;everyone,&rdquo; he instructed.
&ldquo;Flora, where are you? Can you not show yourself
that we may know it is truly your spirit which communicates
with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the cabinet, so close to Al Gepper that she
could have touched his hand, Penny was able to see
his every move. Yet so swift was his next action, that
she barely discerned it.</p>
<p>Taking a wet sponge from his pocket he wiped it
across the painting previously prepared. The picture
immediately became visible to the audience as Gepper
focused his flashlight on the canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t the way he made Mrs. Weems&rsquo; picture
appear,&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;The fellow must have a
great repertoire of tricks!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>The s&eacute;ance had become so interesting that she no
longer thought of escape. Nevertheless, she came to
a sudden realization of her precarious position as she
heard the medium say that he would next endeavor to
persuade the Spirit of Flora to take actual shape. With
a shock it dawned upon her that in another moment
the man would enter the cabinet to make use of the
luminous gauze robe and other paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Knowing that she could not hide from him, Penny
decided upon a bold break for freedom. Dropping the
ghostly robe over her face and shoulders, she pulled
aside the dark curtain and flitted into the room.</p>
<p>Her dramatic entrance brought gasps of astonishment
from the persons who sat at the circular table.
The medium, as dumbfounded as his audience muttered:
&ldquo;What the dickens!&rdquo; and pushed back his chair,
his legs rasping on the floor.</p>
<p>Penny did not linger, but darted past the group and
groped for the door. In the darkness she could not
immediately find it. Her shining robe, on the other
hand, made her an easy target for Al Gepper.</p>
<p>Angrily the medium strode across the room, seizing
her arm. She jerked away, but he grasped a fold of the
robe. It tore and was left behind.</p>
<p>At that critical instant, Penny&rsquo;s hand encountered
the door. She swung it open, and bounded down the
stairway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>In the s&eacute;ance chamber a light went on, then the
hallway became brilliantly illuminated. But by that
time the girl was in the dining room.</p>
<p>She could hear Al Gepper clattering down the
steps, intent upon capturing her. Penny was determined
that he should never learn her identity.</p>
<p>Letting herself out of the house by way of the
kitchen door, she decided that if she attempted to
cross the yard, the medium certainly would recognize
her. The woodpile offered a hiding place and she
crouched behind it.</p>
<p>Scarcely had she secreted herself, when Al Gepper
ran into the yard. He glanced about carefully and
circled the house twice.</p>
<p>Finally, convinced that the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; had escaped he
came back to the porch. His customers, greatly agitated
by what had occurred, were demanding explanations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone played a prank,&rdquo; Gepper explained
briefly. &ldquo;It will be impossible to resume the s&eacute;ance for
the spirits are offended. You will leave, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The customers departed and the medium locked
himself in the house. He did not bother to lower the
upstairs hall blind, and Penny caught occasional
glimpses of him as he moved to and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s packing to leave!&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;Unless I
act in double-quick time, he&rsquo;ll skip town! I must
notify Dad and the police without an instant&rsquo;s delay!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>SCALING THE WALL</i></h2>
<p>The nearest drugstore with a public telephone
was two blocks away. Penny ran the distance, and
slipping into the booth, she dialed the <i>Star</i> office.
Informed by the building switchboard operator that
neither her father nor DeWitt was available, she inquired
for Jerry Livingston, and to her relief was connected
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Jerry, this is Penny!&rdquo; she began excitedly.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time to explain, but the lid is blowing off
the fake spiritualist story! Rush the police out to the
Hodges&rsquo; cottage and demand Al Gepper&rsquo;s arrest! Send
another squad or some private detectives to Mr.
Henley&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henley!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed. &ldquo;Say, have you gone
loco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making any mistakes,&rdquo; Penny replied
tersely. &ldquo;If you act quickly we may prevent a robbery.
I&rsquo;m on my way there now to warn Mr. Henley! Oh,
yes, try to find Dad or DeWitt and warn them a big
story is breaking!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, what&rsquo;s this all about?&rdquo; the reporter demanded.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to the police unless I know what
I am doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must, Jerry. I have plenty of evidence against
Gepper and his crowd, but unless you take the police
to the Hodges&rsquo; in the next fifteen minutes it will be
too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without giving Jerry opportunity to delay her with
other questions, Penny hung up the receiver. Hastening
to the street, she gazed frantically about for a
taxi. None was to be had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to the Henley place quicker in Lena than
by waiting for a cab to come along,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>The battered old car had been parked a short
distance from the Hodges&rsquo; cottage. Hurrying there,
Penny jumped into the ancient vehicle and started
the motor. As usual it made a loud clatter, but she did
not suspect that the sound carried far up the street.
Nor did she guess that Al Gepper stood at the darkened
window of his room, watching her.</p>
<p>Penny drove as fast as she could to the Henley home
in the southern section of Riverview. Lights blazed
from the downstairs windows.</p>
<p>Abandoning her car in the driveway, she rang the
doorbell. After a long wait, a maid appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Henley here?&rdquo; Penny asked breathlessly.
&ldquo;Or Mrs. Henley? It&rsquo;s most important that I talk with
them at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Henley has been at the seashore for a month,&rdquo;
the maid replied in an agitated voice. &ldquo;Mr. Henley is
somewhere downtown. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get him,
but the telephone wire has been cut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house hasn&rsquo;t been robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Henley&rsquo;s jewelry has been taken! I don&rsquo;t
know what else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did it happen?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been during the last half hour. I went
to the corner store for a book of stamps. When I came
back five minutes ago I discovered what had occurred.
I ought to call the police, but I am afraid to do it until
I&rsquo;ve talked with my employer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police already have been notified,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you know&mdash;?&rdquo; the maid began in
astonishment.</p>
<p>Penny had turned away. She was convinced that
the burglary had been committed by Slippery. Perhaps,
by this time he had fled town, but she did not
believe he would leave without his pal, Al Gepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Climbing into the car again, Penny debated. It was
reasonable to suppose that, having accomplished the
burglary, Slippery would return to the Hodges&rsquo; cottage
to meet the medium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does, the police should be on hand to seize
him,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;At least, he and Al will be held
for questioning. But there&rsquo;s one place I forgot to cover&mdash;the
Celestial Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flash came the recollection that Slippery had
been deeply interested in something which was
guarded in the bell tower. Was it not possible that
he might return there before leaving Riverview?</p>
<p>Shifting gears, Penny turned the car and headed for
Butternut Lane. Anxiously, she glanced at the gasoline
gauge. It registered less than a gallon of fuel and she
had used her last dime in the telephone booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I coast on all the downgrades I should just make
it,&rdquo; she estimated.</p>
<p>In starting for the Celestial Temple Penny was
acting upon a &ldquo;hunch.&rdquo; However, it disturbed her that
the Henley burglary had been accomplished, and she
was afraid she might again be wasting precious time.
Now that it was too late, she wondered if it would not
have been wiser to remain at the Hodges&rsquo; cottage until
the police arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope that end of the affair isn&rsquo;t bungled,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never get over it if Al and Slippery
both escape.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Penny had reached the entrance to Butternut Lane.
Parking at the side of the road, she continued afoot
toward the Celestial Temple.</p>
<p>From a distance the building appeared dark. However,
as she drew closer she could distinguish a dim
light. Inside the Temple, a stout man wearing a hat
sat with his chair tilted against the door of the bell
tower room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be the guard,&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;Probably
the one they call Pete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she paused, retreating into a clump of
elder bushes near the walk. From the direction of the
cemetery a figure emerged. At first, all that Penny
could distinguish was a man carrying a suitcase. As
he drew closer, her pulse quickened. Unmistakably, it
was Slippery.</p>
<p>Without passing the bushes where the girl had taken
refuge, the man walked on toward the Temple.
Presently he halted. Glancing carefully about to assure
himself that he was unobserved, he shoved his suitcase
into the tall weeds which lined the walk. Then he
moved to one of the Temple windows, peering into
the gloomy interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; thought Penny, watching alertly.
&ldquo;This should prove interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Slippery remained beneath the window a minute
or two. Instead of entering the Temple, he presently
returned to the high weeds, stooping to remove some
object from his suitcase. Hiding it under his coat, he
circled the building and approached the side adjoining
the cemetery.</p>
<p>Thoroughly mystified, Penny cautiously followed,
taking care that her body cast no shadow which would
attract Slippery&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>The man seemed deeply engrossed in the task he
had set for himself. From his coat he took a collapsible
rod which he extended to the approximate length of
a fish pole. To its end he attached a trailing silken
ladder.</p>
<p>Deftly the man raised the ladder until two metal
hooks bit into a projection of the bell tower. He
tested the ropes to make certain they would bear his
weight then, with the agility of a cat, mounted the
silken rungs. Penny saw him disappear into the bell
tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why did he climb up there?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;He must be after something hidden in the
belfry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny knew that she was a long distance from police
aid, but it was unthinkable that Slippery should be
allowed to escape. Impulsively, she moved from her
hiding place to the base of the tower.</p>
<p>Grasping the silken ladder, she gave it a quick jerk
which dislodged the two iron hooks. Down it tumbled
into her arms, leaving the man trapped in the turret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never dare call for help when he discovers
what has happened,&rdquo; reasoned Penny. &ldquo;If he does, the
guard, Pete, will have something to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rolling the ladder into a small bundle, she started
across the clearing, intending to seek the nearest telephone.
With no thought of lurking danger, she
brushed past a clump of bushes. A hand reached out
and grasped her arm.</p>
<p>Penny screamed in terror and tried to break free.
The hand help her in a grip of steel.</p>
<p>As she struggled, her captor emerged from the
shelter of leaves. It was Al Gepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I might find you here, my little one,&rdquo;
he said grimly. &ldquo;You have had your fun. Now you
must pay, and the entertainment shall be mine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">23</span>
<br /><i>A PRISONER IN THE BELFRY</i></h2>
<p>Penny tried to scream, only to have Al Gepper
clamp his hand over her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of that!&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;Behave yourself
or you&rsquo;ll get rough treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside the Temple, lights suddenly were turned on,
for the brief struggle had been heard by Pete. The
squat, stupid-faced man appeared in the doorway of
the building, peering down the lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he demanded suspiciously.</p>
<p>Al Gepper uttered an angry word beneath his
breath. It was not to his liking that Pete should be
drawn into the affair. However, he could not avoid
detection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Al!&rdquo; he called softly. &ldquo;This girl broke up my
s&eacute;ance tonight, and I trailed her here. She was
prowling around the bell tower.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>As he spoke, he dragged Penny toward the Temple
entrance. His words convinced her that he had not
observed her remove the silken ladder from the belfry
wall, nor was he aware that Slippery was a prisoner in
the tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at her,&rdquo; said Pete. He flashed a
light directly into Penny&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the Parker girl&mdash;daughter of the publisher,&rdquo;
informed Al.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; commented Pete. &ldquo;I saw her at one of our
meetings. Another girl was with her. How much has
she learned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to get us all run out of town. The question
is, what shall we do with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her inside, and we&rsquo;ll talk it over,&rdquo; said Pete.
&ldquo;Maybe we ought to call a meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Al Gepper impatiently, shoving
Penny through the doorway. &ldquo;We can take care of
this ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was locked from the inside. Al pushed
Penny into a chair on the front platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now sit there,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;One peep out of you
and we&rsquo;ll tie you up and tape your mouth. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui, oui, Monsieur</i>,&rdquo; said Penny, mockingly.</p>
<p>The two men stepped a few paces away and began
to whisper together. Pete seemed to protest at Al&rsquo;s
proposals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Penny watched them uneasily, speculating upon
their final decision. Whatever it was, she would never
be given an opportunity to report to the police until
it was too late to apprehend members of the Temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was stupid not to realize that Gepper might trail
me,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;If only I had used an ounce of
caution, I might have brought about the capture of the
entire gang. Not to mention a grand scoop for Dad&rsquo;s
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny slumped lower in her chair. Her own predicament
concerned her far less than the knowledge that
she had bungled a golden opportunity.</p>
<p>Speculatively, her gaze shifted toward the bell tower
room. The door was closed and she believed that it
must be locked. There was no sound from the belfry,
adding to her conviction that the man imprisoned
there was fearful of attracting attention to his plight.</p>
<p>Al Gepper and Pete came toward her. With no
explanation, the medium seized her arm and ordered
her to walk toward the exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. You&rsquo;ll find out in good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny, bracing her legs and refusing
to be pushed. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll let me go, I&rsquo;ll tell you
something very much worth your while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Deliberately, she allowed the silken ladder to slip
from beneath her coat. The men would not have
heeded her words, but the familiar object served its
purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that ladder?&rdquo; demanded Al
Gepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would like to know what became of your
friend, Slippery?&rdquo; responded Penny evenly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be surprised when I tell you that he has double-crossed
you both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying,&rdquo; accused Gepper.</p>
<p>Penny shrugged and did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you going to say?&rdquo; Gepper prodded
in a moment. &ldquo;Out with it! How did you get Slippery&rsquo;s
ladder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It fell into my hands, literally and figuratively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stalling for time will get you nowhere,&rdquo; snapped
Gepper, losing patience. &ldquo;If you know anything about
Slippery spill it fast or you&rsquo;ll not have another chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend tried to double-cross you,&rdquo; declared
Penny. She decided to make a shrewd guess. &ldquo;Tonight,
after he robbed the Henley home he came here intending
to loot the bell tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the dirty sneak!&rdquo; exclaimed Pete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you here on guard all evening?&rdquo; Gepper
demanded, turning to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I was. I never set foot outside the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slippery wasn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen him since yesterday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the girl is lying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, the girl isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; refuted Penny. &ldquo;If you care
for proof you&rsquo;ll find it in the tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean Slippery. He&rsquo;s hiding in the belfry now,
hoping you&rsquo;ll not discover him there. You see, he
scaled the wall by means of this silk ladder. I removed
the ladder, and I assume he&rsquo;s still up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the low-down skunk!&rdquo; Pete exclaimed
wrathfully. &ldquo;So he planned to rob us! I&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Al to watch Penny, the guard ran to the
tower room door and unlocked it. Stealthily he crept
up the iron stairway which led to the belfry.</p>
<p>Suddenly those below heard a cry of rage, followed
by the sound of scuffling. Al Gepper listened tensely,
yet made no move to join the fight. He remained
standing between Penny and the outside door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; he admitted in a stunned voice.
&ldquo;Slippery&rsquo;s up there. He meant to get all the swag for
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fight increased in intensity as the two men
struggled on the belfry steps. Over and over they
rolled, first one delivering a hard blow, and then the
other. Still locked, they finally toppled to the floor,
but even then Al Gepper remained a bystander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Penny was less concerned with the fight than with
thoughts of escape. She had hoped that Al, too, would
join the battle. Apparently, he was taking no chance
of letting her get away.</p>
<p>She considered attempting a sudden break for freedom,
but immediately abandoned it. The outside door
had been locked by Pete. Before she could turn the
key, Al would be upon her. As for the windows, none
were open. While they might not be locked, it was out
of the question to reach one quickly enough.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s gaze roved to the tower room once more,
and the struggling men. High above their heads she
saw something which previously had not drawn her
attention. It was a loop of rope, hanging from the
belfry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that must be attached to the old church
bell!&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;If only I could reach it, I
might be able to bring help here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the rope dangled high overhead. Even
if she were able to reach the room leading to the
tower, there was nothing upon which she could stand
to grasp the loop. Obviously the rope had been cut
short years before to prevent anyone from ringing
the bell.</p>
<p>Penny glanced toward Al Gepper. The medium&rsquo;s
gaze was upon the two struggling men, not her. A
golden opportunity presented itself, if only she had the
wits to make use of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Almost at the girl&rsquo;s feet lay the tangle of silken
ladder. As she stared at it, a sudden idea took possession
of her. The iron hooks would serve her purpose,
but dared she try it? If she failed&mdash;and the chances
were against her&mdash;punishment would be certain.</p>
<p>Yet, if she did nothing and merely waited, it was
likely that Al Gepper and his pals never would be
brought to justice. She must take the chance, no matter
how great the personal risk.</p>
<p>For a moment Penny remained inactive, planning
what she must do. If she made a single mistake,
fumbled at the critical instant, everything would be
lost. Above all, her aim must be accurate. If she missed
the loop&mdash;</p>
<p>Slippery and Pete were beginning to tire, their
blows becoming futile and ineffective. Further delay
in executing her plan only increased the danger. She
must act now or never.</p>
<p>Her mind made up, Penny no longer hesitated. With
a quick movement she seized the silken ladder and
darted to the doorway of the bell tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; shouted Al Gepper, starting after her.</p>
<p>Penny slammed the door in his face. Taking careful
aim, she hurled the silken ladder upward. One of the
iron hooks caught in the loop of the rope. She jerked
on it, and to her joy, the bell began to ring.</p>

<br /><i>THE WOODEN BOX</i></h2>
<p>Penny pulled the rope again and again, causing
the huge bell to sway back and forth violently. It
rang many times before Al Gepper succeeded in
opening the tower room door.</p>
<p>His face was crimson with fury when he seized the
girl, hurling her away from the rope. With one quick
toss he released the hooks of the silken ladder, stuffing
the soft strands beneath his coat. The bell made a final
clang and became silent.</p>
<p>Penny retreated against the wall, anticipating severe
punishment for her act. However, Al and his companions
were more concerned with thoughts of escape
than with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out of here,&rdquo; muttered Al. &ldquo;Come
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men on the floor had ceased their struggles.
Painfully they regained their feet. In this sudden
emergency they had forgotten their differences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do about the box in the tower?&rdquo;
Pete demanded, nursing a swollen eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it here,&rdquo; returned Al. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t save anything
now. The police are apt to swoop down on us
any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, he fled to the street. Pete and Slippery
hesitated, then followed. Penny heard a key turn in
the lock. Even before she tested the door she knew
she had been imprisoned in the tower room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve escaped after all,&rdquo; she thought dismally.
&ldquo;But I may have saved some of the loot. I&rsquo;ll take a
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly she climbed the iron stairs to the belfry.
From the turret she obtained a perfect view of the
entire Lane. Al Gepper was running down the street,
while Pete and Slippery had turned toward the
cemetery.</p>
<p>There were no other persons in the vicinity, Penny
thought at first glance. Then her heart leaped as she
saw three men entering the Lane at its junction with
the main street. They, too, were running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have heard the bell!&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Oh, if only I can make them understand what has
happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her best means of attracting attention was by ringing
the bell. She pushed against it and was rewarded
by a deafening clang.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>The men stopped short, staring toward the belfry.
Penny cupped her hands and shouted. Her words did
not carry plainly, but the newcomers seemed to gain
an inkling of what was amiss, for they wheeled and
began to pursue the two who had taken refuge in the
cemetery.</p>
<p>From her high perch, Penny saw Al Gepper nearing
the end of the Lane, unobserved by all save herself.
Tapping the bell again, she called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him, too! At the end of the street!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the pursuers halted, turning toward the
tower. In the moonlight Penny saw his face and recognized
Jerry Livingston. He was close enough now
to hear her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Al Gepper!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him
escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter turned, but as he started off in the
new direction, both he and Penny saw the fleeing man
climbing into Leaping Lena. With a grinding of gears,
he drove away. Jerry stopped, thinking that he never
could overtake the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep after him, Jerry!&rdquo; encouraged Penny. &ldquo;The
gas tank is almost empty. He can&rsquo;t possibly go more
than three or four blocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the reporter again took up the chase, she began
tolling the bell once more, determined to arouse everyone
within a mile of the Temple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Her energy was rewarded, for in another minute
she heard the familiar wail of a siren. A police cruiser
swerved alongside the tower, stopping with a lurch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of ringing that bell?&rdquo; demanded
an officer, leaping to the ground.</p>
<p>Tersely Penny explained the situation. The two
policemen took a short-cut through a vacant lot,
circling the cemetery. Darkness swallowed them, but
presently there came a muffled command to halt, followed
by a revolver shot.</p>
<p>So excited was Penny that she nearly tumbled from
the bell tower. Recovering her balance, she sat on the
stone ledge, trying to remain calm. Her nerves were
jumpy and on edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Jerry captures Al Gepper&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I
ask!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>As the minutes elapsed, it occurred to her that she
had not yet searched for the loot which she believed
to be hidden in the belfry. With questing fingers
she groped beneath the ledge. For a short distance she
felt nothing. Then she encountered a long wooden
box.</p>
<p>Before she could open it, she heard shouts from the
direction of the cemetery. Four men, two of them
police officers, were marching Slippery and Pete toward
the Temple. As they came nearer she received
another pleasant surprise. The two who had aided in
the capture were her father and Salt Sommers, a
photographer for the <i>Star</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; shouted Penny. &ldquo;Can you get me down
from this pigeon roost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker, separating from the others, came to
the foot of the bell tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was you who sounded the alarm!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I might have known! How did you get up
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m locked in. Dad, send the police to help Jerry.
He&rsquo;s after Al Gepper who rode off in my car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police cruiser was dispatched, leaving one
officer to guard the two prisoners. Mr. Parker unlocked
the door of the tower room, releasing his
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Here&rsquo;s a little present for you.&rdquo; Penny
thrust the wooden box into his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. I found it hidden in the belfry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, if you fell into a river you would come up
with a chest of gold!&rdquo; exclaimed the publisher admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it quick, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker required no urging. The box was locked
but he pried off the cover hinges, exposing the contents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A real treasure!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny.</p>
<p>The box contained several bracelets, one of them
set with rubies and diamonds, countless rings, four
watches, and several strings of matched pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen loot!&rdquo; ejaculated the publisher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a collection!&rdquo; chuckled Penny as she
examined the separate pieces. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough plunder
here to start a jewelry store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likewise sufficient evidence to put this Celestial
Temple gang out of circulation for a long, long time,&rdquo;
added her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned a lot tonight, Dad. Wait until I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scoop for the <i>Star</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to use your largest, blackest headlines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny began to tell her story, interrupting only
when Slippery and Pete were brought into the building
handcuffed together. Starting again, she made her
charges, accusing Slippery not only of having committed
the Henley burglary, but also of having robbed
the Kohls and many prominent Riverview families.</p>
<p>After inspecting the jewelry found in the wooden
box, one of the police officers definitely identified
several of the pieces as stolen goods. He expressed an
opinion that the jewelry had been hidden in the belfry
because it was too &ldquo;hot&rdquo; to be disposed of by fences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The organization members had an agreement by
which all shared in the loot,&rdquo; added Penny. &ldquo;That
caused trouble. Al Gepper and Slippery thought they
were taking most of the risk without sufficient return.
So they pulled a few extra jobs of their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could reveal more, the police car was
heard outside the Temple. From the window Penny
saw that Jerry and the policeman were returning with
Al Gepper who had been handcuffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve caught him!&rdquo; she cried jubilantly.</p>
<p>The prisoner was brought into the Temple to be
identified. He had been captured when Leaping Lena
had stalled for lack of gasoline.</p>
<p>As Gepper was searched, the silken ladder, and
various small objects were removed from his coat.
Penny noticed two tiny rubber suction cups no larger
than dimes, and immediately made up her mind that
later she would try to obtain them. She was quite
certain she knew their purpose.</p>
<p>Penny told her story and learned, in turn, that after
she had telephoned Jerry, he had traced her father, and
with the police both had hastened to the Hodges&rsquo;
cottage. Arriving there, they discovered that Gepper
had fled. Jerry, Mr. Parker, and Salt Sommers had
immediately proceeded to the Celestial Temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was lucky you rang that bell, Penny,&rdquo; chuckled
Jerry. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t, we never would have arrived
here in time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was lucky, too, that Mr. Gepper tried to escape
in Lena,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I guess my old rattle-trap has
redeemed itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the officers picked up the silken ladder,
examining it with critical interest. He agreed that it
had undoubtedly been used in many mysterious burglaries
committed during the past month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious that Slippery approached the houses
on the &lsquo;blind&rsquo; side, and scaled the wall after hooking
his ladder into a window ledge,&rdquo; Penny remarked.
&ldquo;I suppose he reasoned that second-story windows
nearly always are left unlocked. But how did he learn
the houses were deserted? By telephoning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be my opinion,&rdquo; nodded the policeman.
&ldquo;If someone answered, he could hang up. Otherwise,
he would be fairly sure the house was empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night at the theatre I saw a man who resembled
Slippery noting down the license number of
the Kohl car. But the house was robbed within a few
hours after that. How could he have obtained the
name and address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily. There are &lsquo;information fences&rsquo; who supply
such data to fellow members of the underworld. It
is also possible that Slippery previously had watched
the Kohl house, obtained the car license number, and
then watched for it later at the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Jerry already had supplied police with the name of
the fence whose establishment Slippery had visited
earlier in the day. Later, a raid staged there brought
to light much loot taken from various Riverview
homes.</p>
<p>However, for the moment, police were most interested
in gaining complete information which could
be used in rounding up all members of the Celestial
Temple Society who had not fled the city.</p>
<p>Searching Slippery they found, not only jewelry
stolen from the Henley residence, but a booklet containing
many names and telephone numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie Beardsell,&rdquo; Penny read. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of the
members, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lest Mr. and Mrs. Hodges might also be arrested,
she explained that the old couple had been an innocent
dupe of Al Gepper. Turning to the medium she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know how you accomplished most of
your tricks. Of course, you were the one who sent
Mrs. Hodges a letter with six dollars. Undoubtedly,
you had it mailed by an accomplice from New York
at exactly the hour you specified. Then at that same
hour you slipped up to the Hodges&rsquo; cottage, and
rapped six times on the bedroom wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have everything figured out,&rdquo; Al
Gepper responded sarcastically. &ldquo;Clever girl!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I saw how you made the spirit painting tonight at
the s&eacute;ance,&rdquo; resumed Penny. &ldquo;May I ask if that same
method was used in regard to Mrs. Weem&rsquo;s picture of
Cousin David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not dream that the medium would answer
her question. With a shrug which implied that the
entire matter was very boring, he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the picture was painted with a solution of
sulphocyanid of potassium and other chemicals, invisible
until brought out with a re-agent. During the
s&eacute;ance, an assistant sprayed the back of the canvas
with an atomizer, bringing out the colors one by one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how was the paint made to appear wet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poppy oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more question, Mr. Gepper. I never could
understand how you were able to raise the kitchen
table at Mrs. Hodges&rsquo; cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Al Gepper smiled mockingly. &ldquo;I assure you
I had nothing to do with that demonstration. It was
a true spirit manifestation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe that,&rdquo; declared Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then figure it out for yourself,&rdquo; replied the
medium. &ldquo;You are such a very brilliant child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the prisoners were led to the police car, Salt
Sommers set up his camera and took a number of flashlight
pictures for the <i>Star</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Mr. Parker?&rdquo; inquired Jerry eagerly.
&ldquo;Are we putting out an extra?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said the publisher crisply. &ldquo;This is the
big break I&rsquo;ve been hoping we would get! We should
beat the <i>Record</i> on the story by at least a half hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men hurriedly left the Celestial Temple,
with Penny trailing behind them. At the main street
intersection they finally obtained a taxicab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the <i>Star</i> office,&rdquo; Mr. Parker ordered. &ldquo;An extra
dollar if you step on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about my pictures?&rdquo; Salt Sommers asked, as
the cab rocked around a corner. &ldquo;They ought to be
dandies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rush them through as soon as we get to the office,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker instructed. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re any good we&rsquo;ll run
&rsquo;em on page one. Jerry, you handle the story&mdash;play it
for all it&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry glanced at Penny who sat very still between
her father and Salt. Their eyes met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a sort of fraternity among
reporters&mdash;an unwritten rule that we never chisel on
each other&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked, startled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his glance fell upon his daughter, and he
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s that way! You think Penny should write
the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Chief. It&rsquo;s hers from the ground floor up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Dad, may I?&rdquo; Penny pleaded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>The cab rolled up to the <i>Star</i> office, stopping with a
jerk. Mr. Parker swung open the door, helping her
alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story is yours, Penny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is, if
you can crack it out fast enough to make the extra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it or die in the attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep to the facts and write terse, simple English&mdash;&rdquo;
Mr. Parker began, but Penny did not wait to hear his
instructions.</p>
<p>With a triumphant laugh, she ran ahead into the
<i>Star</i> office. Her entry into the newsroom was both
dramatic and noisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big scoop, Mr. DeWitt,&rdquo; she called cheerily. &ldquo;Start
the old print factory running full blast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping into a chair behind the nearest typewriter,
she began to write.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>EXTRA!</i></h2>
<p>Penny stood at the window of her father&rsquo;s office,
listening to the newsboys crying their wares on the
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Police Capture
Three in Raid on Celestial Temple! Extra! Extra!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker rocked back in his swivel chair, smiling
at his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your story was first-class, Penny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thanks
to you we scooped the <i>Record</i>. Tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do feel rather washed out,&rdquo; Penny admitted.
&ldquo;Writing at high speed with a deadline jabbing you in
the back is worse than facing a gang of crooks. But it
was exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You turned in a good story,&rdquo; her father praised
again. &ldquo;In fact, you may as well take credit for breaking
up that outfit of fake spiritualists.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So far the police have only captured Al Gepper,
Slippery and Pete. There&rsquo;s not much evidence against
the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but rest assured those who aren&rsquo;t rounded up
will leave Riverview. The backbone of the organization
has been smashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sank wearily into a chair, picking up a copy
of the <i>Star</i> which lay on her father&rsquo;s desk. Two-inch,
black headlines proclaimed the capture, and opening
from the banner was her own story tagged with a
credit line: <i>by Penelope Parker</i>. Salt Sommer&rsquo;s photographs
had made the front page, too, and there was
a brief contribution by Jerry telling of Al Gepper&rsquo;s attempted
flight in Leaping Lena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, you must admit that it was a stroke of genius
when I bought back that old car,&rdquo; remarked Penny.
&ldquo;Why, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Lena, Al Gepper surely
would have escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That and the fact you always run your cars on
an empty tank,&rdquo; responded Mr. Parker. &ldquo;I suppose you
foresaw the future when you made your brilliant purchase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. It was just a feeling I had&mdash;the same
sort of hunch which came to me when I found the
silken ladder at Kano&rsquo;s Curio Shop. If I depended upon
a mere brain to solve mysteries, why I&rsquo;d be no better
than the police.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your modesty overwhelms me,&rdquo; chuckled her
father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful my other reporters aren&rsquo;t guided
by their instincts. Otherwise I might have a scoop a
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing which annoys me,&rdquo; Penny said,
frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of Al Gepper&rsquo;s tricks haven&rsquo;t been explained.
How was he able to raise a table and read a message in
a sealed envelope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking to the Chief of Police about that letter
trick only this morning, Penny. Magicians often
employ it. Wasn&rsquo;t the message written on a pad of
paper before it was placed in the envelope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then very likely Gepper read the message from
the pad. He could have placed carbon paper beneath
the second or third sheets. Possibly he resorted to a
thin covering of paraffin wax which would be less
noticeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I recall it, he did glance at the pad! How
would you guess he lifted the table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were his hands held high above it, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only an inch or two. However, he never touched
the table. I was able to see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he have used sharp, steel pins held between
his fingers?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. But I think I know what he may have
used! Did you notice two small suction cups which
were taken from his pockets by the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I didn&rsquo;t, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The longer I mull over it, the more I&rsquo;m convinced
he used them to raise the table. They could be held between
the fingers and wouldn&rsquo;t be observed in a darkened
room. Dad, if I can get those rubber cups from
the police, I&rsquo;ll have some fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone rang. It was Mrs. Weems calling to
ask if Penny were safe. Mr. Parker replied in the affirmative
and handed the receiver to his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, I just read your story in the paper,&rdquo; the
housekeeper scolded. &ldquo;You never should have pitted
yourself against those dangerous men! I declare, you
need someone to watch you every minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need you,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;And so does Dad. Why
not promise to stay with us instead of going away on
a trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll remain,&rdquo; came Mrs. Weems&rsquo; surprising
answer. &ldquo;I made up my mind to that two days ago.
You and your father never could take care of yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with your inheritance, Mrs.
Weems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your father will invest it for me,&rdquo; replied
the housekeeper meekly. &ldquo;One thing I know. No medium
will tell me what to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>The hour was late. Penny felt relieved when her
father locked his desk in preparation for leaving the
office.</p>
<p>They walked through the newsroom, down the stairway
to the street. A middle-aged man in a brown suit
and derby hat alighted from a taxi, pausing as he saw
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;May I speak with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publisher turned, recognizing him. &ldquo;Mr. Henley!&rdquo;
he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just come from the police station,&rdquo; the advertiser
said in an agitated voice. &ldquo;I was told that your
daughter is responsible for the capture of the men who
robbed our home tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Penny managed to have a rather busy evening,&rdquo;
smiled Mr. Parker. &ldquo;I hope you suffered no
loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything was recovered, thanks to your daughter.
Miss Parker, I realize I never can properly express
my appreciation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry I couldn&rsquo;t prevent the burglary,&rdquo; replied
Penny stiffly. &ldquo;As it turned out, the capture of
the crooks was mostly due to luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too modest,&rdquo; protested Mr. Henley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
talked with the police, you know. I am truly grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>The man hesitated, evidently wishing to say more,
yet scarcely knowing how to shape his words. Penny
and her father started to move away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about that contract we were discussing today,&rdquo;
the advertiser said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Mr. Parker paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking it over. I acted too hastily in deciding
to cancel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henley, please do not feel that you are under
obligation,&rdquo; said the publisher quietly. &ldquo;Even though
Penny accidentally did you a favor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; Mr. Henley interrupted. &ldquo;The <i>Star</i> is
a good paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best in Riverview,&rdquo; said Penny softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is!&rdquo; Mr. Henley declared with sudden emphasis.
&ldquo;I tell you, Parker, I was irritated because of a
trivial mistake in my firm&rsquo;s copy. I&rsquo;ve cooled off now.
Suppose we talk over the matter tomorrow at lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Parker. &ldquo;The Commodore
Hotel at one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bowing to Penny, Mr. Henley retreated into a waiting
taxi and drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like that, Dad?&rdquo; Penny inquired after
a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Parker. &ldquo;The <i>Star</i> could
have limped along without Mr. Henley. But the going
would have been tough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll renew the old contract?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and probably give us a better one. Stealing
Mr. Henley&rsquo;s words, I am truly grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed at her father with twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those idle words, Dad? Or are you willing to
back them in a material way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might,&rdquo; grinned Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Present your bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dad, I&rsquo;ve discovered to my sorrow that I
can&rsquo;t support two cars on my present allowance. I need
a generous raise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could get rid of Lena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad! After her noble work tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Parker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
earned an increase, and I may as well grant it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Retroactive to the time I started working on the
story,&rdquo; added Penny. &ldquo;I figure if you pay back allowance,
I&rsquo;ll be solvent once more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drive a hard bargain,&rdquo; chuckled the publisher.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arm in arm, they started on down the street. Rounding
a corner of the <i>Star</i> building they abruptly paused
before the plate-glass window to watch a long, unbroken
sheet of white paper feed through the thundering
press. Freshly inked newspapers, cut and folded,
slid out one upon the other to be borne away for distribution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s modern magic, isn&rsquo;t it, Dad?&rdquo; Penny said reflectively
as the great machine pounded in steady
rhythm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Penny,&rdquo; her father agreed. &ldquo;And for this edition,
at least, you were the master magician!&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
